  abstract = {As cross-lingual information retrieval is attracting increasing attention, tools that measure cross-lingual semantic similarity between documents are becoming desirable. In this paper, two aspects of cross-lingual semantic document similarity measures are investigated: One is document representation, and the other is the formulation of similarity measures. Fuzzy set and rough set theories are applied to capture the inherently fuzzy relationships among concepts expressed by natural languages. Our approach first develops a language-independent sense-level document representation based on the fuzzy set model to reduce the barrier between different languages and further explores the fuzzy-rough hybrid approach to obtain a more robust macrosense-level document representation through the partitioning of the integrated sense association network of the document collection into macrosenses. Then, Tversky's notion of similarity and the F1 measure on information retrieval are adopted to formulate, respectively, two document similarity measures with fuzzy set operations on the two proposed document representations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by its success rate in identifying the English translations to their corresponding Chinese documents in a collection of Chinese-English parallel documents. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to process documents in other languages. It is believed that the proposed representations, along with the similarity measures, will enable more effective text mining processes.},

The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature. © 2010 IEEE.},

This study investigated the effects that the major context of use (work vs. non-work) has had on experiences with the social book marking service. A within-subject experiment was conducted with 77 subjects. Each took part in both work and non-work information tasks by interacting with six navigation aids. The MANOVA analysis results showed that the contexts of use, work versus non-work, have a significant effect on user information interaction experiences. Moreover, user expertise for work-related tasks has a significant impact on the user perceptions of navigation aids as helpful way finding cues. Understanding how users interact with various way finding cues can enlighten design considerations for refining social navigation functions.

The identification scheme consists of a set of filters. The first is related with social consensus, user-count ratio, and n-gram properties of tags. The next relies on look-up functions across multiple databases to determine the probable semantic layer of each tag. Examples of the semantic layers with prevalence rates are given based on application of the scheme to a subset of the Million Song Dataset. Finally, a validation of the results was carried out with an independent, smaller hand-annotated dataset, in which high agreement between the identification provided by the scheme and annotations was found.},

Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size.},

Social tags are the keywords annotated by users to the multimedia objects. These tags contain the information which allows multimedia objects to be located and classified. Unfortunately, irrelevant information and noise are frequently included in such tags, especially when we use social tagging systems. Imperfect as they may be, social tags are still a significant source of human-generated contextual knowledge. We present the Waking And Sleeping (WAS) algorithm to overcome the obstacle of noisy tags. WAS refines social tags of each image and assigns each tag into either the waking state or the sleeping state. With WAS, the recommendation system not only enhances the accuracy of the recommendation results based on tags with higher quality but also reduces the consumption of computational resources. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to compared methods.},

Many millions of citizens around the world own smartphones, which they use for both personal and business applications. The majority of smartphones are designed towards Location-based Services (LBS). Consequently these smartphones have on-board GPS devices with the ability of locating the user to an accuracy of a few meters. While at the begining of the growth in popularity of smartphones and LBS technologies most users simply consumed services: where is the nearest coffee shop or subway station? Today, citizens are generating spatial data and information at ever increasing volumes. Examples include: georeferenced photographic collections, location-based social networking such as FourSquare, and volunteered geographic information (VGI). VGI is an exciting movement whereby citizens collect spatial data and information about (their own or another) locality. This content is then shared in collaborative projects such as OpenStreetMap, Geonames, Google Maps Mashups, or WikiMapia. This paper explores the risks involved in using this user-generated spatial data and information with specific emphasis on OpenStreetMap. Most citizens are not specialists in geographic surveying or cartography. Our paper provides results of a large case-study of high edit geographical features. We show that user generated spatial data is a very dynamic but has many inconsistencies.},

  abstract = {Large-scale user contributed images with tags are easily available on photo sharing websites. However, the noisy or incomplete correspondence between the images and tags prohibits them from being leveraged for precise image retrieval and effective management. To tackle the problem of tag refinement, we propose a method of Ranking based Multi-correlation Tensor Factorization (RMTF), to jointly model the ternary relations among user, image, and tag, and further to precisely reconstruct the user-aware image-tag associations as a result. Since the user interest or background can be explored to eliminate the ambiguity of image tags, the proposed RMTF is believed to be superior to the traditional solutions, which only focus on the binary image-tag relations. During the model estimation, we employ a ranking based optimization scheme to interpret the tagging data, in which the pair-wise qualitative difference between positive and negative examples is used, instead of the point-wise 0/1 confidence. Specifically, the positive examples are directly decided by the observed user-image-tag interrelations, while the negative ones are collected with respect to the most semantically and contextually irrelevant tags. Extensive experiments on a benchmark Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for tag refinement. We also show attractive performances on two potential applications as the by-products of the ternary relation analysis.},

The meaning of a tag as well as the precise relation between a tag and the tagged resource are left open for interpretation to the user. Although human users mostly have a fair chance at interpreting this relation, machines do not. In this paper we study the characteristics of the problem to identify descriptive tags, i.e. tags that relate to visible objects in a picture. We investigate the feasibility of using a tag-based algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that ignores actual picture content, to tackle the problem. Given the theoretical feasibility of a well-performing tag-based algorithm, which we show via an optimal algorithm, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a WordNet-based algorithm as proof-of-concept. These two investigations lead to the conclusion that even relatively simple and fast tag-based algorithms can yet predict human ratings of which objects a picture shows. Finally, we discuss the inherent difficulty both humans and machines have when deciding whether a tag is descriptive or not. Based on a qualitative analysis, we distinguish between definitional disagreement, difference in knowledge, disambiguation and difference in perception as reasons for disagreement between raters. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

We present the results from two empirical studies over 36 and 12 months, respectively, on how tagging has been adopted and what role it plays in the development processes of several professional development projects with more than 1,000 developers in total. Our research shows that the tagging mechanism was eagerly adopted by the teams, and that it has become a significant part of many informal processes. Different kinds of tags are used by various stakeholders to categorize and organize work items. The tags are used to support finding of tasks, articulation work, and information exchange. Implicit and explicit mechanisms have evolved to manage the tag vocabulary. Our findings indicate that lightweight informal tool support, prevalent in the social computing domain, may play an important role in improving team-based software development practices.},

In this scenario, OSNs are considered critical applications with respect to the security of users and their resources, for their characteristics alone: the large amount of personal information they manage, big economic upturn connected to their commercial use, strict interconnection among users and resources characterizing them, as well as user attitude to easily share private data and activities with strangers. In this book, we discuss three main research topics connected to security in online social networks: (i) trust management, because trust can be intended as a measure of the perception of security (in terms of risks/benefits) hat users in an OSN have with respect to other (unknown/little-known) parties; (ii) controlled information sharing, because in OSNs, where personal information is not only connected to user profiles, but spans across users' social activities and interactions, users must be provided with the possibility to directly control information flows; and (iii) identity management, because OSNs are subjected more and more to malicious attacks that, with respect to traditional ones, have the advantage of being more effective by leveraging the social network as a new medium for reaching victims. For each of these research topics, in this book we provide both theoretical concepts as well as an overview of the main solutions that commercial/non-commercial actors have proposed over the years. We also discuss some of the most promising research directions in these fields.},

  abstract  = {Tagging recommender systems allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The connection among users, resources and these annotations, often called afolksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, and to obtain recommendations. Releasing these tagging datasets accelerates both commercial and research work on recommender systems. However, adversaries may re-identify a user and her/his sensitivity information from the tagging dataset using a little background information. Recently, several private techniques have been proposed to address the problem, but most of them lack a strict privacy notion, and can hardly resist the number of possible attacks. This paper proposes an private releasing algorithm to perturb users' profile in a strict privacy notion, differential privacy, with the goal of preserving a user's identity in a tagging dataset. The algorithm includes three privacy preserving operations: Private Tag Clustering is used to shrink the randomized domain and Private Tag Selection is then applied to find the most suitable replacement tags for the original tags. To hide the numbers of tags, the third operation, Weight Perturbation, finally adds Lap lace noise to the weight of tags We present extensive experimental results on two real world datasets, Delicious and Bibsonomy. While the personalization algorithmis successful in both cases.},

The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and “cold start” problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative tf ·idf weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD.},

User profiling techniques have performed the core role in this research. Traditionally, most user profiling techniques create user representations in a static way. However, changes of user interests may occur with time in real world applications. In this research we develop algorithms for mining user interests by integrating time decay mechanisms into topic-based user interest profiling. Time forgetting functions will be integrated into the calculation of topic interest measurements on in-depth level. The experimental study shows that, considering temporal effects of user interests by integrating time forgetting mechanisms shows better performance of recommendation.},

Most of the available modules in recommender systems, don't consider information such as time that could be effective on the users preferences of a resource. So, one of the existing challenges in resource recommendation systems is the appropriate integration of tag and time information to discover user's taste considering time drift and improving accuracy. In this paper data from social tagging systems are modeled with four-mode tensors to capture four-way correlations between users, items, tags and time information. Then by applying multi-way analysis, latent correlations among users preferences based on time information are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. The advantages of proposed system are that it considers simultaneous relations among elements, discovers latent associations and improves the quality of recommendations accuracy. The experimental results on a real-world dataset, Citeulike, indicate significant improvements in recommendation quality and better performance compared with the existing systems.},

The technology does not rely on actual content of the items, but instead requires users to indicate preferences, most commonly in the form of ratings. While CF is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, a trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, all existing trust-based approaches use trust as a factor independent from scope, whether explicit or implicit. We argue that trustworthiness should not be the same across all conditions; hence the trust values should change to suit certain scope or focused area. To validate the proposed temporal-focused trustworthiness in this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based approach to calculate trustworthiness by focusing on time factor. Implementation of the proposed approach is hoped to reduce cold-start and sparsity as well as improve accuracy of the recommendation results.},

We have developed a MATLAB toolbox called CTAGGER to enable a user-friendly, semi-structured and expandable strategy for event annotation in dynamic brain imaging and other time-series. To facilitate common labeling and comparison across data collections and laboratories, an individual's annotation can be collected in a common community database to encourage annotation reuse.

A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, enable a user to annotate various web resources with a free set of tags for sharing and searching purposes. Tags in a folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition about information. Tags play an important role in a folksonomy as a means of indexing information to facilitate search and navigation of resources. However, the semantics of the tags, and therefore the semantics of the resources, are neither known nor explicitly stated. It is therefore difficult for users to find related resources due to the absence of a consistent semantic meaning among tags. The shortage of relevant tags increases data sparseness and decreases the rate of information extraction with respect to user queries. Defining semantic relationships between tags, resources, and users is an important research issue for the retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this research, a method for finding semantic relationships among tags is proposed. The present study considers not only the pairwise relationships between tags, resources, and users, but also the relationships among all three. Experimental results using real datasets from Flickr and Del.icio.us show that the method proposed here is more effective than previous methods such as LCH, JCN, and LIN in finding semantic relationships among tags in a folksonomy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {Social networks have become the main media for information dissemination in the so-called Web 2.0. The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Körner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Our results show that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning; however some issues must be addressed to prevent an excessive number of categorizer students and, also, a premature convergence of the vocabulary of tags. Our conclusions are specific for the setting of our experiment, but we generalize them as much as possible suggesting guidelines of how to use social tagging in e-learning.},

  abstract  = {Social media systems are becoming more and more popular nowadays. In order to face the overload in the amount of users and content available in these systems, social recommender systems have been developed and are largely studied in the literature. A form of social media, known as social bookmarking system, allows to share bookmarks in a social network. A user adds as a friend or follows another user and receives updates on the bookmarks added by that user. However, no approach in the literature proposes friend recommender systems in the social bookmarking domain. In this paper, we present an analysis of the state-of-the-art on user recommendation in social environments and of the structure of a social bookmarking system, in order to derive a design and an architecture of a friend recommender system in the social bookmarking domain. This study can be useful for any future research in this area, by highlighting the aspects that characterize this domain and the features that this type of recommender system has to offer.},

  abstract = {One potential disadvantage of social tagging systems is that due to the lack of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, images, users, or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of resources in social tagging systems may become semantically stable over time, as more and more users tag them and implicitly agree on the relative importance of tags for a resource. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new questions such as: 1) how can we assess semantic stability in a robust and methodical way? 2) does the semantic stabilization varies across different social tagging systems and ultimately, and 3) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in such systems? In this work, we tackle these questions by: 1) presenting a novel and robust method, which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods; 2) empirically investigating semantic stabilization in different social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties; and 3) detecting potential causes of stabilization and implicit consensus, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams that are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams that are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone.},

  abstract  = {Many automated software engineering approaches, including code search, bug report categorization, and duplicate bug report detection, measure similarities between two documents by analyzing natural language contents. Often different words are used to express the same meaning and thus measuring similarities using exact matching of words is insufficient. To solve this problem, past studies have shown the need to measure the similarities between pairs of words. To meet this need, the natural language processing community has built WordNet which is a manually constructed lexical database that records semantic relations among words and can be used to measure how similar two words are. However, WordNet is a general purpose resource, and often does not contain software-specific words. Also, the meanings of words in WordNet are often different than when they are used in software engineering context. Thus, there is a need for a software-specific WordNet-like resource that can measure similarities of words. In this work, we propose an automated approach that builds a software-specific WordNet like resource, named WordSimSEDB, by leveraging the textual contents of posts in StackOverflow. Our approach measures the similarity of words by computing the similarities of the weighted co-occurrences of these words with three types of words in the textual corpus. We have evaluated our approach on a set of software-specific words and compared our approach with an existing WordNet-based technique (WordNetres) to return top-k most similar words. Human judges are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two techniques. We find that WordNetres returns no result for 55 % of the queries. For the remaining queries, WordNetres returns significantly poorer results.},

Tagging is in fact a sharply skewed process in which a small minority of users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations. Using data from the social music site Last.fm as a case study, this paper explores the implications of this tagging imbalance. Partitioning the folksonomy into two halves - one created by the prolific minority and the other by the non-prolific majority of taggers - we examine the large-scale differences in these two sub-folksonomies and the users generating them, and then explore several possible accounts of what might be driving these differences. We find that prolific taggers preferentially annotate content in the long-tail of less popular items, use tags with higher information content, and show greater tagging expertise. These results indicate that "supertaggers" not only tag more than their counterparts, but in quantifi- ably different ways. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

  abstract      = {User-generated content shapes the dynamics of the World Wide Web. In particular, collaborative tagging represents a simple, yet powerful, feature that enables users to share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to first understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue by characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems. The analysis of the patterns of information production shows that users publish new content more often than they annotate already existing content in the system. The opposite, however, occurs for tags; the level of tag reuse is much higher. The study of the temporal dynamics of user vocabularies shows that the growth rate of tag vocabularies across the user population over time decreases at early ages, stabilizes, and returns to increase for older users. Moreover, a closer look into the change of vocabulary contents over time shows that despite the fact that tag vocabularies are slowly growing in size with user age, the relative frequency in which each tag is used converges relatively quickly in a users lifetime. Finally, the characterization of social aspects of tagging unveils the relationship between the implicit user ties, as inferred from the similarity between users' activity, and their explicit social ties, as represented by co-membership in discussion groups or semantic similarity between tag vocabularies. © First Monday, 1995-2014.},

We hypothesize that categories get more differentiated over time as students learn, and that semantic stabilization on the group level (i.e. the convergence in the use of tags) mediates this relationship. Results of a field experiment that tested the impact of topic study duration on the specificity of tags confirms these hypotheses, although it was not study duration that produced this effect, but rather the effectiveness of the collaborative taxonomy the groups built. In the groups with higher levels of semantic stabilization, we found use of more specific tags and better representation in memory. We discuss these findings with regard to the important role of the information value of tags that would drive both the convergence on the group level as well as a shift to more specific levels of categorization. We also discuss the implication for cognitive science research by highlighting the importance of collaboratively built artefacts in the process of how knowledge is acquired, and implications for educational applications of collaborative tagging environments. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Existing methods focus on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on the final annotation performance.},

  abstract = {Users can enjoy personalized services provided by various context-aware applications that collect users' contexts through sensor-equipped smartphones. Meanwhile, serious privacy concerns arise due to the lack of privacy preservation mechanisms. Currently, most mechanisms apply passive defense policies in which the released contexts from a privacy preservation system are always real, leading to a great probability with which an adversary infers the hidden sensitive contexts about the users. In this paper, we apply a deception policy for privacy preservation and present a novel technique, FakeMask, in which fake contexts may be released to provably preserve users' privacy. The output sequence of contexts by FakeMask can be accessed by the untrusted context-aware applications or be used to answer queries from those applications. Since the output contexts may be different from the original contexts, an adversary has greater difficulty in inferring the real contexts. Therefore, FakeMask limits what adversaries can learn from the output sequence of contexts about the user being in sensitive contexts, even if the adversaries are powerful enough to have the knowledge about the system and the temporal correlations among the contexts. The essence of FakeMask is a privacy checking algorithm which decides whether to release a fake context for the current context of the user. We present a novel privacy checking algorithm and an efficient one to accelerate the privacy checking process. Extensive evaluation experiments on real smartphone context traces of users demonstrate the improved performance of FakeMask over other approaches.},

  abstract      = {As an example of exploring human memory cue use in an ecologically valid context, we present ongoing work to examine the “memory cue hypothesis” in collaborative tagging. In collaborative tagging systems, which allow users to assign freeform textual labels to digital resources, it is generally assumed that tags function as memory cues that facilitate future retrieval of the resources to which they are assigned. There is, however, little empirical evidence demonstrating that this is in fact the case. Employing large-scale music listening and tagging data from the social music website Last.fm as a case study, we present a set of time series and information theoretic analytic methods we are using to explore how patterns of content tagging and interaction support or refute the hypothesis that tags function as retreival cues. Early results are, on average, consistent with the hypothesis. There is an immediate practical application of this work to those working with collaborative tagging systems (are user motivations what we think they are?), but our work also comprises contributions of interest to the cognitive science community: First, we are expanding our understanding of how people generate and use memory cues “in the wild.” Second, we are enriching the “toolbox” available to cognitive scientists for studying cognition using large-scale, ecologically valid data that is latent in the logged activity of web users. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract  = {An important challenge in Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) is architectural knowledge vaporization, i.e., the loss of technical knowledge due to a lack of documentation. In a previous work we identified that technical knowledge is usually available in unstructured textual electronic means (e.g. chat, mail, blogs, etc. - also known as UTEMs) used by AGSD workers during development, although not necessarily easily accessible. Also, we proposed the concept of Knowledge Condensation as a means to recover knowledge from UTEMs, by introducing a structure to their contents along with means to retrieve knowledge. In this work we present our first step towards a Knowledge Condensation tool, through a prototype tagging mechanism to structure architectural knowledge during UTEM interactions. We evaluated the prototype and obtained the following results: (1) a high perception of usefulness and a high projected intention of use, and (2) the identification of 6 tagging behavior profiles from participants. These tagging behaviors can be grouped as (i) participants who tag as expected, (ii) participants who tag more than expected, and (ii) participants who tag less than expected. These results suggest that it is important to cope with "little or no tagging" and "excessive tagging" behaviors to implement knowledge condensation based on UTEM tagging. Furthermore, we identified that tagging could be a good option to structure UTEM interactions, and to retrieve architectural knowledge from UTEM logs. Future work includes improving the tagging mechanism prototype based on the participants' suggestions and overall evaluation results, and implementing a searcher prototype to further evaluate the concept of knowledge condensation based on tagging of UTEM interactions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we first offer an overview of advances in the field of distance metric learning. Then, we empirically compare selected methods using a common experimental protocol. The number of distance metric learning algorithms proposed keeps growing due to their effectiveness and wide application. However, existing surveys are either outdated or they focus only on a few methods. As a result, there is an increasing need to summarize the obtained knowledge in a concise, yet informative manner. Moreover, existing surveys do not conduct comprehensive experimental comparisons. On the other hand, individual distance metric learning papers compare the performance of the proposed approach with only a few related methods and under different settings. This highlights the need for an experimental evaluation using a common and challenging protocol. To this end, we conduct face verification experiments, as this task poses significant challenges due to varying conditions during data acquisition. In addition, face verification is a natural application for distance metric learning because the encountered challenge is to define a distance function that: 1) accurately expresses the notion of similarity for verification; 2) is robust to noisy data; 3) generalizes well to unseen subjects; and 4) scales well with the dimensionality and number of training samples. In particular, we utilize well-tested features to assess the performance of selected methods following the experimental protocol of the state-of-the-art database labeled faces in the wild. A summary of the results is presented along with a discussion of the insights obtained and lessons learned by employing the corresponding algorithms.},

Existing methods to collaborative filtering (CF) emphasize to scale well up to large and sparse dataset, lacking of scalable approach to dealing with new data. In this paper, we consider a novel method for alleviating the problem by incorporating content-based information about users and items, i.e., tags and keywords. The user-item ratings imply the relevance of users’ tags to items’ keywords, so we convert the direct prediction on the user-item rating matrix into the indirect prediction on the tag-keyword relation matrix that adopts to the emergence of new data. We first propose a novel neighborhood approach for building the tag-keyword relation matrix based on the statistics of tag-keyword pairs in the ratings. Then, with the relation matrix, we propose a 3-factor matrix factorization model over the rating matrix, for learning every user’s interest vector for selected tags and every item’s correlation vector for extracted keywords. Finally, we integrate the relation matrix with the two kinds of vectors to make recommendations. Experiments on real dataset demonstrate that our method not only outperforms other state-of-the-art \{CF\} algorithms for historical data, but also has good scalability for new data. },

Most focus on popular subsets, e.g., images containing landmarks or associated to Wikipedia articles. In this work we are concerned with the problem of accurately finding the location where a photo is taken without needing any metadata, that is, solely by its visual content. We also recognize landmarks where applicable, automatically linking them to Wikipedia. We show that the time is right for automating the geo-tagging process, and we show how this can work at large scale. In doing so, we do exploit redundancy of content in popular locations---but unlike most existing solutions, we do not restrict to landmarks. In other words, we can compactly represent the visual content of all thousands of images depicting e.g., the Parthenon and still retrieve any single, isolated, non-landmark image like a house or a graffiti on a wall. Starting from an existing, geo-tagged dataset, we cluster images into sets of different views of the same scene. This is a very efficient, scalable, and fully automated mining process. We then align all views in a set to one reference image and construct a 2D scene map. Our indexing scheme operates directly on scene maps. We evaluate our solution on a challenging one million urban image dataset and provide public access to our service through our online application, VIRaL.},

A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our thesaurus in a case study of normalizing questions from Stack Overflow and CodeProject.},

  abstract        = {Alongside the enormous volume of user-generated content posted to World Wide Web, there exists a thriving demand for search personalization services, especially those utilizing collaborative tagging data. To provide personalized services, a user model is usually required. We address the setting adopted by the majority of previous work, where a user model consists solely of the user’s past information. We construct an augmented user model from a number of tags and documents. These resources are further processed according to the user’s past information by exploring external knowledge base. A novel generative model is proposed for user model generation. This model leverages recent advances in neural language models such as Word Embeddings with latent semantic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We further present a new query expansion method to facilitate the desired personalized retrieval. Experiments conducted by utilizing real-world collaborative tagging data show that the methods proposed in the current paper outperform several non-personalized methods as well as existing personalized search methods by utilizing user models solely constructed from usage histories. © 2017, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Tags can be helpful if used for the recommendation since they reflect characteristic content features of the resources. However, there are few researches which introduce tags into the recommendation. This paper proposes a tag-based recommendation framework for scientific literatures which models the user interests with tags and literature keywords. A hybrid recommendation algorithm is then applied which is similar to the user-user collaborative filtering algorithm except that the user similarity is measured based on the vector model of user keywords other than the rating matrix, and that the rating is not from the user but represented as user-item similarity computed with the dot-product-based similarity instead of the cosine-based similarity. Experiments show that our tag-based algorithm is better than the baseline algorithm and the extension of user model and dot-product-based similarity computation are also helpful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community Web sites.},

A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

In this paper, a co-clustering approach is employed, that exploits joint groups of related tags and social data sources, in which both social and semantic aspects of tags are considered simultaneously.

Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.

In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of network-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of an answer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue that obvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive, due to the dependence of scores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintaining score upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag, over the entire collection of users. The resulting bounds are very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their networks. We show that finding the optimal clustering of seekers is intractable, but we provide heuristic methods that give substantial time improvements. We then give an optimization that can benefit smaller populations of seekers based on clustering of taggers.

Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters.

  abstract  = {Social tagging has become very popular with the rise of Web 2.0, making it an important piece of the puzzle that makes up the web phenomenon. In contrast to more elaborate ways of organizing resources, such as taxonomies or ontologies, tagging is very easy to use and understand. Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit, formalized, structures. By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles (a set of related tags) can automatically be derived from a bag of tags. Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling. For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency. We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way. We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance.},

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

We report results of an experimental study in which we examined the interaction between individual expertise and the basic level advantage in collaborative tagging. The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts.

The collective knowledge expressed though user-annotated data has a big potential, but needs to be filtered in a digest form so that the search result better reflects the users' preferences and actual aims. Starting from these considerations, our work presents an agent-based approach for a scalable semi-automatic generation of annotation tags, personalized on each user's preferences and tastes.

In this paper, we investigate how to enhance Web clustering by leveraging the tripartite network of social tagging systems. We propose a clustering method called “Tripartite Clustering” which clusters the three types of nodes (resources, users, and tags) simultaneously by only utilizing the links in the social tagging network. We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation-based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering. Compared to social-annotation-based K-means and Link K-means, Tripartite Clustering achieves equivalent or better performance and produces more useful information.},

This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

The 'Tagging' is a mean for users to express themselves freely through additions of label called 'Tags' to shared resources. One of the problems encountered in current tagging systems is to define the most appropriate tag for a resource. Tags are typically listed in order of popularity, as del-icio-us. But the popularity of the tag does not always reflect its importance and representativeness for the resource to which it is associated. Starting from the assumptions that the same tag for a resource can take different meanings for different users, and a tag from a knowledgeable user would be more important than a tag from a novice user, we propose an approach for weighting resource's tags based on user profile. For this we define a user model for his integration in the tag weight calculation and a formula for this calculation, based on three factors namely the user, the degree of approximation between his interest centers and the resource field, expertise and personal assessment for tags associated to the resource. A resource descriptor containing the best tags is created. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract  = {Social communication websites has been an emerging type of a Web service that helps users to share their resources. For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naïve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation.},

In contrast, editorial annotations from production music libraries are meant to be incisive in nature. We compare the efficiency of these two data sources in capturing semantic information on mood expressed by music. First, a semantic computing technique devised for mood-related tags in large datasets is applied to Last.fm and I Like Music (ILM) corpora separately (250,000 tracks each). The resulting semantic estimates are then correlated with listener ratings of arousal, valence and tension. High correlations (Spearman's rho) are found between the track positions in the dimensional mood spaces and listener ratings using both data sources (0.60 <; rs <; 0.70). In addition, the use of curated editorial data provides a statistically significant improvement compared to crowd-sourced data for predicting moods perceived in music.},

  abstract  = {With the permission of annotating blog posts with tags, tags has become one of the most important resources used to describe blogger features. However, due to the irregular quality of tags, not all tags are appropriate for representing blogger's preferences. Poor tags or spam tags confuse the actual user's preferences and spam terms, thus they should be detected before they are directly used to tag bloggers. A detailed quantitative analysis on the categories of tag spam in the blogosphere is presented in this paper. Taking advantage of abundant text contents in blog posts and the relatively stable semantic relationship between tags and their target posts, an unsupervised approach based on topic models is proposed to evaluate tag quality for blogger modelling in the blogosphere. The latent interest topics of a blogger are mined out through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The blog post of the blogger is represented as a distribution over latent topics and a latent topic is a distribution over words of the vocabulary. A tag is also expressed as a specific co-occurrence term vector. Ultimately, a scheme is devised to determine the similarity between each tag and its target blog post. Then the tags with less similarity value can be identified as poor tag. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves more promising performance than the baselines on datasets collected from Sina Blog, which is one of the biggest Chinese blogs.},

  abstract = {Recommendation systems play an important role in many practical applications that help users manage information and provide personalized recommendations. The context in which a choice is made is an important factor for recommendation systems. Recently, researchers extended the classical matrix factorization to enable generic integration of contextual information by modeling the relevant data as a tensor. However, current tensor factorization methods have two important limitations: (1) computing costs can be very high in practice and (2) they can only be applied to static conditions. In this paper, we propose the GPUTENSOR, a parallel tensor factorization algorithm, to accelerate the tensor factorization of large datasets to support efficient context-aware recommendations. The basic idea of this algorithm is to partition a tensor into smaller blocks and then exploit the inherent parallelism and high memory bandwidth of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to perform tensor related operations in parallel. Furthermore, based on the observation that contextual information changes dynamically and frequently, we present GPUTENSOR+, an effective incremental method that models the apparent changes of a tensor by adaptively updating its previously factorized components instead of recomputing them on the whole dataset every time data are changed. Experiments indicate that the proposed methods can achieve significant timesavings without a significant loss in accuracy. As an important data mining tool, these methods can be used a potential basis for many other interesting tensor applications, such as clustering, trend detection, social network analysis, and latent concept discovery.},

In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.},

The rapid adoption of these systems has led to an increasing amount of users providing information about themselves and, at the same time, a growing and rich corpus of social knowledge that can be exploited by recommendation technologies. In this context, tripartite relationships between users, resources, and tags contained in folksonomies set new challenges for knowledge discovery approaches to be applied for the purposes of assisting users through recommendation systems.

The proposed methods are evaluated against real datasets and the results show that they are more efficient than previous methods, which are appropriate for a large number of web resources.

Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is firstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identification or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.},

Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

Using frequency data and co-word analysis matrices analyzed by multi-dimensional scaling, the authors discovered that tagging practices to some extent work in ways that are continuous with conventional indexing. Small numbers of tags tend to emerge by unspoken consensus, and inconsistencies follow several predictable patterns that can easily be anticipated. However, the tags also indicated intriguing practices relating to time and task which suggest the presence of an extra dimension in classification and organization, a dimension which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

  abstract        = {As a fundamental and critical component of music information retrieval (MIR) systems, music genre classification has attracted considerable research attention. Automatically classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic information embedded in tags supplied by users of social networking websites. Particularly, we consider the tag information by creating a graph of tracks so that tracks are neighbors if they are similar in terms of their associated tags. Two classification methods based on the track graph are developed. The first one employs a classification scheme which simultaneously considers the audio content and neighborhood of tracks. In contrast, the second one is a two-level classifier which initializes genre label for unknown tracks using their audio content, and then iteratively updates the genres considering the influence from their neighbors. A set of optimizing strategies are designed for the purpose of further enhancing the quality of the two-level classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data collected from Last.fm. Promising experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using tags for accurate music genre classification.

We have evaluated this method on a large repository of governmental Web services. The evaluation shows that relatively simple techniques are surprisingly cost-effective, saving hundreds of man-hours of semantic annotation effort. Moreover, the proposed method does not assume the availability of a preexisting ontology or controlled vocabulary. Instead, the space of annotations is dynamically built during the annotation process.},

We then perform a set of experiments to study the information value of search engine queries when treated as "tags" or "labels" for the web pages that both appear as a result and the user actually clicks on. We ask how much extra information these query
tags provide for web pages by comparing them to tags from the del.icio.us bookmarking site and to the pagetext. We find that query tags can provide substantially many (on average 250 tags per URL), new tags (on average 125 tags per URL are not present in the pagetext) for a large fraction of the Web.},

  abstract  = {The problem of automatic music mood classification is addressed by resorting to low-rank representation of slow auditory spectro-temporal modulations. Recently, it has been shown that if each data class is linearly spanned by a subspace of unknown dimensions and the data are noiseless, the lowest-rank representation (LRR) of a set of test vector samples with respect to a set of training vector samples has the nature of being both dense for within-class affinities and almost zero for between-class affinities. Consequently, the LRR exactly reveals the classification of the data, resulting into the so-called Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (LRRC). The performance of the LRRC is compared against three well-known classifiers, namely the Sparse Representations-based Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Nearest Neighbor classifiers for music mood classification by conducting experiments on the MTV and the Soundtracks180 datasets. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the LRRC among the classifiers that is compared to.},

Here, the knowledge is extracted from unlabeled objects through unsupervised learning and applied to perform supervised classification tasks. To mine more meaningful correlation knowledge, instead of using commonly used visual words in the traditional bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model, we discover higher level visual components (words and phrases) to incorporate the spatial and semantic information into our image representation model, i.e., bag-of-visual-phrases (BoP). By combining the enriched visual components with the textual words, we calculate the frequently co-occurring pairs among them to construct a cross-domain correlated graph in which the correlation knowledge is mined. After that, we investigate two different strategies to apply such knowledge to enrich the feature space where the supervised classification is performed. By transferring such knowledge, our cross-domain transfer learning method can not only handle large scale web multimedia objects, but also deal with the situation that the textual descriptions of a small portion of web images are missing. Empirical experiments on two different datasets of web multimedia objects are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed cross-domain transfer learning method.},

  abstract  = {The large amounts of software repositories over the Internet are fundamentally changing the traditional paradigms of software maintenance. Efficient categorization of the massive projects for retrieving the relevant software in these repositories is of vital importance for Internet-based maintenance tasks such as solution searching, best practices learning and so on. Many previous works have been conducted on software categorization by mining source code or byte code, which are only verified on relatively small collections of projects with coarse-grained categories or clusters. However, Internet-based software maintenance requires finer-grained, more scalable and language-independent categorization approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchically categorize software projects based on their online profiles across multiple repositories. We design a SVM-based categorization framework to classify the massive number of software hierarchically. To improve the categorization performance, we aggregate different types of profile attributes from multiple repositories and design a weighted combination strategy which assigns greater weights to more important attributes. Extensive experiments are carried out on more than 18,000 projects across three repositories. The results show that our approach achieves significant improvements by using weighted combination, and the overall precision, recall and F-Measure can reach 71.41%, 65.60% and 68.38% in appropriate settings. Compared to the previous work, our approach presents competitive results with 123 finer-grained and multi-layered categories. In contrast to those using source code or byte code, our approach is more effective for large-scale and language-independent software categorization.},

To deal with the problem, numerous approaches employed semantic techniques in terms of annotation (or tagging) and service discovery algorithms. However, the problem of semantic service discovery based on the identification of fine-grained goals of users and services is still challenging due to the lack of semantic information in Web services. To enable the goal-driven semantic service discovery, we propose an automatic functional-goals tagging approach which employs a set of natural language processing (NLP) procedures based on the descriptions of Web services. In addition, to check the effectiveness of the functional-goals tagged, we designed a goal-driven semantic service discovery algorithm and compared it with other approaches: keyword-based, ontology-based, and topic-based service discovery. As results, our proposed goal-driven semantic service discovery achieved 75.7% of precision and 59.6% of recall (finally, F1=62%) that outperform other discovery approaches.},

  abstract      = {Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},
