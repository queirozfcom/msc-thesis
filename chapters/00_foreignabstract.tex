This dissertation presents two proposals related to predicting tags on Text-based Social Tagging Systems (STS). Firstly, we verify the difference in performance of several label ranking techniques on two different datasets. Secondly, we verify whether a specific label ranking technique, namely MIMLSVM, generalizes to dense text representations in addition to traditional (bag-of-words) sparse ones. Experiments are conducted on the two datasets and results are analyzed.
