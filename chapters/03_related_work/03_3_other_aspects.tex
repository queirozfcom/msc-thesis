\section{Other Aspects}\label{section:other_aspects}

\subsection{Feature Representation}

talk about feature learning like word/document embeddings, 

\cite{tatu_etal_2008} Embeds user profiles and resource profiles in the same feature space.

\cite{han_etal_2010} project video features and image features into the same subspace. Transfer learning.

\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction}

\cite{song_etal_2008} Low Rank Matrix Factorization

\subsection{Classification versus Ranking}

Authors that specifically frame the problem as a ranking problem.

\cite{sigurbjoernsson_zwol_2008}

\cite{chen_etal_2008}

\cite{cao_etal_2009} Ranking SVM, only suggests top 5 tags.

\cite{song_etal_2008,song_etal_2011}

\cite{belem_etal_2014}

\ednote{anyone who uses metrics such as P@k, R@k, F1@k, etc}

\subsection{Clustering}

\cite{nikolopoulos_etal_2009} Break down images into objects then try to cluster individual objects using k-means then use SVM.

\cite{leginus_etal_2012} Groups tags into clusters (according to different forms of tag co occurrence) to reduce tag sparsity and then applied HOSVD on the folksonomy 3D Tensor.
Different cluster techniques are used, such as Correlated Feature Hashing, Spectral K-Means, K-Means and Mean-Shift. Optimal Parameters for HOSVD are found using Genetic Algorithms.
