In this section, we will present general approaches to tag prediction, with a special focus on broad folksonomies, that being our problem scope.

\ednote{here, talk about resource-centered, user-centered, cite ties to recommender systems, multi label classification and multi label ranking.}


As related to how authors name their particular approaches, one should be careful inasmuch as there is no apparent consensus as to what constitutes a \textit{recommendation} approach vis-a-vis a \textit{prediction} approach with respect to STSs. 

It is frequently the case in the literature that the word "recommendation" is used to refer to methods that use no user-specific information whatsoever and, conversely, words like "prediction" and "suggestion" used in cases where personalized recommendations are made.
