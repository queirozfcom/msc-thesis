\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my family, my advisor Prof. Xex√©o, DSc. for inspiring and advising me, Fellipe Duarte, DSc. for patiently answering my questions about scientific research and all staff at COPPE-Sistemas. 

In addition, I would not have been able to finish this work without the indirect help of the countless contributors to open-source projects around the world.
