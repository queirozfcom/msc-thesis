  abstract      = {Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize information items (songs, pictures, web links, products etc.). Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against two state-of-the-art tag recommendations algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision. © 2008 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Social image analysis and retrieval is important for helping people organize and access the increasing amount of user tagged multimedia. Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications.},

Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

Two documents that are maintained in the collection of the same user and/or assigned similar sets of tags can be considered as related from the perspective of the user, even though they may not be connected by hyperlinks. We call this kind of implicit relations user-induced links between documents. We consider two methods of identifying user-induced links in collaborative tagging, and compare these links with existing hyperlinks on the Web. Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web. We also propose to use these links as a basis for predicting how documents would be tagged. Our experiments show that they achieve much higher accuracy than existing hyperlinks.

We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

Then we construct a tag graph according to the co-tag relationships and perform a topic-level random walk over the graph to suggest a ranking score for each tag at different topics. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed tag ranking approach.},

  abstract      = {Due to the visually polysemous barrier, videos and images may be annotated by multiple tags. Discovering the correlations among different tags can significantly help predicting precise labels for videos and images. Many of recent studies toward multi-label learning construct a linear subspace embedding with encoded multi-label information, such that data points sharing many common labels tend to be close to each other in the embedded subspace. Motivated by the advances of compressive sensing research, a sparse representation that selects a compact subset to describe the input data can be more discriminative. In this paper, we propose a sparse multi-label learning method to circumvent the visually polysemous barrier of multiple tags. Our approach learns a multi-label encoded sparse linear embedding space from a related dataset, and maps the target data into the learned new representation space to achieve better annotation performance. Instead of using l1-norm penalty (lasso) to induce sparse representation, we propose to formulate the multi-label learning as a penalized least squares optimization problem with elastic-net penalty. By casting the video concept detection and image annotation tasks into a sparse multi-label transfer learning framework in this paper, ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, and the multi-label extended sparse discriminant analysis methods are, respectively, well explored and compared.},

To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

As the large majority of users enters only very few tags, good tag recommendation can vastly improve the usability of tags for techniques such as searching, indexing, and clustering. Previous research has shown that accurate recommendation can be achieved by using conditional probabilities computed from tag associations. The main problem, however, is that enormous amounts of associations are needed for optimal recommendation. We argue and demonstrate that pattern selection techniques can improve tag recommendation by giving a very favourable balance between accuracy and computational demand. That is, few associations are chosen to act as information source for recommendation, providing high-quality recommendation and good scalability at the same time. We provide a proof-of-concept using an off-the-shelf pattern selection method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Experiments on data from Delicious, LastFM and YouTube show that our proposed methodology works well: applying pattern selection gives a very favourable trade-off between runtime and recommendation quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Both visual features and tags plays important role in the research field. Existing approach uses tags and visual features consecutively or independently to estimate the relevance of images. In this paper we tackle the problems of Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) for image retrieval that delivers the global image search engine that covers different applications such as Image to Image Retrieval, Image to Tag suggestions, Tag to Image Retrieval and Tag to Tag suggestion which is based on user contributed tags on the websites such as flicker. The proposed approach comprises of global feature extractions of images. Then we predicate relationship between image and tag by using asymmetric graph as a probabilistic view. Once the relationship is found ranking is employed with the help of t-step random walk model. Finally pseudo relevance feedback is applied on the ranked images. Additionally experimental analysis of above model is conducted on Corel image dataset to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

  abstract      = {Social tagging has grown in popularity on the web due to its effectiveness in organizing and accessing web pages. This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

Collaborative tagging data reflects the semantic perception of users, thus providing valuable information for the related recommendation problems, e.g. tag recommendation, resource recommendation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging services by generalizing the traditional manifold ranking idea. Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays, with the explosive growth of web information, the webpage classification faces great challenge. Computers have difficulty in understanding the semantic meaning of textual or non-textual webpages. Fortunately, Web 2.0 based collaborative tagging system brings new opportunities to solve this problem. It abstracts structured tags from unstructured content in webpages. However, large numbers of webpages on the Internet are less popular. Their tagging information is sparse, which makes their topic unclear and leads to ambiguous classification. Illuminated by the "ambiguous classification", we name the less popular webpage "hesitant webpage". In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for hesitant webpages classification. Firstly, hesitant webpages are divided into bridges, hubs and attached webpages according to their roles on the Internet. Secondly, attached webpages are classified by mining and extending their information in two perspectives. One is the latent semantic analysis (LSA) which is applied to fully explore the semantic meaning of sparse tags. It promotes accurate cognition of webpages semantically close to attached webpages. Another is the proposed density-relation-based rough set model which measures the affiliation degree of attached webpages in different categories. Experiment on real data shows that our approach effectively classifies the hesitant webpages base on the semantic meaning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = { Abstract Social tags are user-generated keywords associated with some resource on the Web. In the case of music, social tags have become an important component of “Web 2.0” recommender systems, allowing users to generate playlists based on use-dependent terms such as chill or jogging that have been applied to particular songs. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting these social tags directly from MP3 files. Using a set of 360 classifiers trained using the online ensemble learning algorithm FilterBoost, we map audio features onto social tags collected from the Web. The resulting automatic tags (or autotags) furnish information about music that is otherwise untagged or poorly tagged, allowing for insertion of previously unheard music into a social recommender. This avoids the “cold-start problem” common in such systems. Autotags can also be used to smooth the tag space from which similarities and recommendations are made by providing a set of comparable baseline tags for all tracks in a recommender system. Because the words we learn are the same as those used by people who label their music collections, it is easy to integrate our predictions into existing similarity and prediction methods based on web data. },

  abstract      = {The emergence of Web 2.0 and the consequent success of social network Web sites such as Del.icio.us and Flickr introduce us to a new concept called social bookmarking, or tagging. Tagging is the action of connecting a relevant user-defined keyword to a document, image, or video, which helps the user to better organize and share their collections of interesting stuff. With the rapid growth of Web 2.0, tagged data is becoming more and more abundant on the social network Web sites. An interesting problem is how to automate the process of making tag recommendations to users when a new resource becomes available.

In this article, we address the issue of tag recommendation from a machine learning perspective. From our empirical observation of two large-scale datasets, we first argue that the user-centered approach for tag recommendation is not very effective in practice. Consequently, we propose two novel document-centered approaches that are capable of making effective and efficient tag recommendations in real scenarios. The first, graph-based, method represents the tagged data in two bipartite graphs, (document, tag) and (document, word), then finds document topics by leveraging graph partitioning algorithms. The second, prototype-based, method aims at finding the most representative documents within the data collections and advocates a sparse multiclass Gaussian process classifier for efficient document classification. For both methods, tags are ranked within each topic cluster/class by a novel ranking method. Recommendations are performed by first classifying a new document into one or more topic clusters/classes, and then selecting the most relevant tags from those clusters/classes as machine-recommended tags.

Experiments on real-world data from Del.icio.us, CiteULike, and BibSonomy examine the quality of tag recommendation as well as the efficiency of our recommendation algorithms. The results suggest that our document-centered models can substantially improve the performance of tag recommendations when compared to the user-centered methods, as well as topic models LDA and SVM classifiers.

Latent relationships and patterns can be discovered by applying tensor factorization techniques like Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), Canonical Decomposition etc. STS accumulate large amount of sparse data that restricts factorization techniques to detect latent relations and also significantly slows down the process of a factorization. We propose to reduce tag space by exploiting clustering techniques so that the quality of the recommendations and execution time are improved and memory requirements are decreased. The clustering is motivated by the fact that many tags in a tag space are semantically similar thus the tags can be grouped. Finally, promising experimental results are presented.},

In this paper, we study personalized tag recommendation in a popular online photo sharing site --- Flickr. Social relationship information of users is collected to generate an online social network. From the perspective of network topology, we propose node topological potential to characterize user's social influence. With this metric, we distinguish different social relations between users and find out those who really have influence on the target users. Tag recommendations are based on tagging history and the latent personalized preference learned from those who have most influence in user's social network. We evaluate our method on large scale real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can outperform the non-personalized global co-occurrence method and other two state-of-the-art personalized approaches using social networks. We also analyze the further usage of our approach for the cold-start problem of tag recommendation.},

Existing tag recommendation methods can be divided into collaborative filtering methods and content based methods.

Our key observation is the tag-content co-occurrence, i.e., many tags have appeared multiple times in the corresponding content. Based on this observation, we propose a generative model (Tag2Word), where we generate the words based on the tag-word distribution as well as the tag itself. Experimental evaluations on real data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, while enjoying linear scalability.},

  abstract      = {The debate within the Web community over the optimal means by which to organize information often pits formalized classifications against distributed collaborative tagging systems. A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

Metadata - data about data - allows systems to collocate related information, and helps users find relevant information. The creation of metadata has generally been approached in two ways: professional creation and author creation. In libraries and other organizations, creating metadata, primarily in the form of catalog records, has traditionally been the domain of dedicated professionals working with complex, detailed rule sets and vocabularies. The primary problem with this approach is scalability and its impracticality for the vast amounts of content being produced and used, especially on the World Wide Web. The apparatus and tools built around professional cataloging systems are generally too complicated for anyone without specialized training and knowledge. A second approach is for metadata to be created by authors. The movement towards creator described documents was heralded by SGML, the WWW, and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. There are problems with this approach as well - often due to inadequate or inaccurate description, or outright deception. This paper examines a third approach: user-‍created metadata, where users of the documents and media create metadata for their own individual use that is also shared throughout a community.},

  abstract      = {Social tagging is an innovative and powerful mechanism introduced with Web 2.0: it shifts the task of classifying resources from a reduced set of knowledge engineers to the wide set of Web users. Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation.},

These sites present a tag cloud made up by the most popular tags, where neither tag grouping nor their corresponding content is considered. We present a methodology to obtain and visualize a cloud of related tags based on the use of self-organizing maps, and where the relations among tags are established taking into account the textual content of tagged documents. Each map unit can be represented by the most relevant terms of the tags it contains, so that it is possible to study and analyze the groups as well as to visualize and navigate through the relevant terms and tags.},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- ||},

abstract="Nowadays social tagging has become a popular way to annotate, search, navigate and discover online resources, in turn leading to the sheer amount of user-generated metadata. This paper addresses the problem of recommending suitable tags during folksonomy development from a graph-based perspective. The proposed approach adapts the Katz measure, a path-ensemble based proximity measure, for the use in social tagging systems. We model a folksonomy as a weighted, undirected tripartite graph. We then apply the Katz measure to this graph, and exploit it to provide tag recommendations for individual users. We evaluate our method on two real-world folksonomies collected from CiteULike and Last.fm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the recommendation performance and is effective for both active taggers and cold-start taggers compared to existing algorithms.",

But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.

  abstract      = {In this paper we present a way to annotate music collections by exploiting audio similarity. In this sense, similarity is used to propose labels (tags) to yet unlabeled songs, based on the content-based distance between them. The main goal of our work is to ease the process of annotating huge music collections, by using content-based similarity distances as a way to propagate labels among songs. <br />
<br />
We present two different experiments. The first one propagates labels that are related with the style of the piece, whereas the second experiment deals with mood labels. On the one hand, our approach shows that using a music collection annotated at 40\% with styles, and using content-based, the collection can be automatically annotated up to 78\% (that is, 40\% already annotated and the rest, 38\%, only using propagation), with a recall greater than 0.4. On the other hand, for a smaller music collection annotated at 30\% with moods, the collection can be automatically annotated up to 65\% (e.g. 30\% plus 35\% using propagation).
