We identify the core principles underlying tag propagation for which we derive suitable scoring models combined in one overall ranking formula. Leveraging these scores, we present an efficient top-k tag selection algorithm that infers additional tags by carefully inspecting neighbors in the document graph.

Readers also bring their own perspective to documents, interpreting them in the light of their own research interests, and initiating, for instance, new connections that may not have been intended by authors. Collaborative, social, tagging holds promise as an approach to mediating these processes via the Web, but may lack the discourse dimension that is fundamental to the articulation of interpretations. We therefore take a hybrid semiformal approach to add structure to freeform folksonomies. Our experience demonstrates that this particular brand of tagging requires tools designed specifically for this sensemaking task by providing enough support to initiate the annotation, while not overwhelming users with suggestions. We describe a tool called ClaimSpotter that aims at supporting this tradeoff, through a novel combination of system-initiated tag recommendations, Web interface design, and an expanded conception of how tags can be both expressed, and semantically linked. We then report a detailed study which analysed the tool's usability and the tag structures created, contributing to our understanding of the implications of adding structure to collaborative tagging.},

Results from the classifiers in terms of precision, recall and F1 score were mixed, suggesting that that not all tags could be used by public users for resource discovery.

However, many real-world domains are currently left out of the social tagging phenomenon due to the lack of a wide-scale tagging-savvy audience - domains like the personal desktop, enterprise intranets, and digital libraries. Hence in this paper, we propose a lightweight interactive tagging framework for providing high-quality tag suggestions for the vast majority of untagged content. One of the salient features of the proposed framework is its incorporation of user feedback for iteratively refining tag suggestions. Concretely, we describe and evaluate three feedback models - Tag-Based, Term-Based, and Tag Co-location. Through extensive user evaluation and testing, we find that feedback can significantly improve tag quality with minimal user involvement.},

In this paper we exploit graph-based tag recommendation strategies, evaluate them in the GroupMe! dataset, and benchmark our results against other approaches.

We have constructed user models for tag prediction using association rules in Bibsonomy, a popular social bookmark and publication sharing system, at three granularity levels: (1) canonical, (2) stereotypical and (3) individual. Our experiments show that prediction accuracy improves if the level of granularity matches the level of participation of the user in the community (i.e., amount of tagging in Bibsonomy).},

While the successes of collaborative tagging systems have been demonstrated by popular websites like Del.icio.us, these sites cover only a small fraction of the available blogs on the web. The vast majority of the blogs are not available on any collaborative tagging system and are often tagged only by the authors. This lack of coverage of collaborative tags is a considerable roadblock in using the tag metadata in a web scale information retrieval system. To solve this problem we propose and implement a system to automatically recommend collaborative tags for a blog. The automatically generated tags will help to surface the blogs by making them available on social book marking sites and allow them to be easily discovered and potentially further tagged by a wider population.

However, it is necessary to take into consideration some particularities of these systems, such as the absence of ratings and the fact that two entity types in a rating scale correspond to three top level entity types, i.e., user, resources and tags.

Collaborative tagging systems recommend tags to users based on what tags other users have used for the same items, aiming to develop a common consensus about which tags best describe an item. However, they fail to provide appropriate tag recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for an information item and (ii) information items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current tag recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items and tags. These data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) technique.

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems have grown in popularity over the Web in the last years on account of their simplicity to categorize and retrieve content using open-ended tags. The increasing number of users providing information about themselves through social tagging activities caused the emergence of tag-based profiling approaches, which assume that users expose their preferences for certain contents through tag assignments. On the other hand, numerous content-based profiling techniques have been developed to address the problem of obtaining accurate models of user information preferences in order to assist users with information-related tasks such as Web browsing or searching. In this paper we propose a hybrid user profiling strategy that takes advantage of both content-based profiles describing long-term information interests that a recommender system can acquired along time and interests revealed through tagging activities, with the goal of enhancing the interaction of users with a collaborative tagging system. Experimental results of using hybrid profiles for tag recommendation are reported and possible applications of these profiles for obtaining personalized recommendations in collaborative tagging systems are discussed. © 2008 IEEE.},

This activity presents some open issues, due in the majority to the manual insertion of tags.

Domain ontologies have a good potential to improve information organization, management and understanding. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for recommending new tags for Web resources by using domain ontologies and key-phrases. The proposed approach is implemented in the PIRATES framework, a prototype system for personalized content retrieval, annotation, and classification. Our approach is then explained with a simple use-case scenario.},

User-defined tags, however, are so variable in quality that searching on these tags alone is ineffective. One way to improve search in bookmarking systems is by adding more metadata to the user-defined tags to enhance tag quality. Such an approach would add value by incorporating information about the content of the resource while retaining the original user-defined tag. Tags automatically extracted from the resource could be the main source for tag enhancement. This paper describes how users' tags can be enhanced with metadata in the form of additional tags automatically extracted from the original document. An evaluation study shows how the enhanced tag set improved user searching in comparison to using only user-defined tags.},

Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications.},

  abstract      = {Online social networking sites such as Flickr and Facebook provide a diverse range of functionalities that foster online communities to create and share media content. In particular, Flickr groups are increasingly used to aggregate and share photos about a wide array of topics or themes. Unlike photo repositories where images are typically organized with respect to static topics, the photo sharing process as in Flickr often results in complex time-evolving social and visual patterns. Characterizing such time-evolving patterns can enrich media exploring experience in a social media repository. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that characterizes distinct time-evolving patterns of group photo streams. We use a nonnegative joint matrix factorization approach to incorporate image content features and contextual information, including associated tags, photo owners and post times. In our framework, we consider a group as a mixture of themes - each theme exhibits similar patterns of image content and context. The theme extraction is to best explain the observed image content features and associations with tags, users and times. Extensive experiments on a Flickr dataset suggest that our approach is able to extract meaningful evolutionary patterns from group photo streams. We evaluate our method through a tag prediction task. Our prediction results outperform baseline methods, which indicate the utility of our theme based joint analysis.},

Different from the original topic-search which employs the keyword-based topic to retrieve and aggregate relevant information, Foxinfo1.0 could organize information from different abstraction level by employing tag to describe the topics of queries and information. Further, in order to predict tags from queries and web documents, a tag prediction algorithm named as CTAG is proposed, which could concern tags from different levels, and performs much better than the baseline method like AutoTag.},

Despite extensive research efforts have been dedicated to labeling, currently automatic image labeling algorithms are still far from satisfactory, and meanwhile manual labeling is rather labor-intensive. In contrast with labeling, tagging works in a free way and therefore it has better user experience for annotators. In this paper, we introduce an active tagging scheme that combines human and computer to assign tags to images. The scheme works in an iterative way. In each round, the most informative images are selected for manual tagging, and the remained images can be annotated by a tag prediction component. We have integrated multiple criteria for sample selection, including ambiguity, citation, and diversity. Experiments are conducted on different datasets and empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Tags of test images are predicted using a weighted nearest-neighbor model to exploit labeled training images. Neighbor weights are based on neighbor rank or distance. TagProp allows the integration of metric learning by directly maximizing the log-likelihood of the tag predictions in the training set. In this manner, we can optimally combine a collection of image similarity metrics that cover different aspects of image content, such as local shape descriptors, or global color histograms. We also introduce a word specific sigmoidal modulation of the weighted neighbor tag predictions to boost the recall of rare words. We investigate the performance of different variants of our model and compare to existing work. We present experimental results for three challenging data sets. On all three, TagProp makes a marked improvement as compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

We consider two methods of identifying user-induced links in collaborative tagging, and compare these links with existing hyperlinks on the Web. Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web. We also propose to use these links as a basis for predicting how documents would be tagged. Our experiments show that they achieve much higher accuracy than existing hyperlinks.

An important element of collaborative tagging systems is the tag recommender, which proposes a set of tags to each newly posted resource. In this paper we discuss the potential role of three tag sources: resource content as well as resource and user profiles in the tag recommendation system. Our system compiles a set of resource specific tags, which includes tags related to the title and tags previously used to describe the same resource (resource profile). These tags are checked against user profile tags - a rich, but imprecise source of information about user interests. The result is a set of tags related both to the resource and user. Depending on the character of processed posts this set can be an extension of the common tag recommendation sources, namely resource title and resource profile. The system was submitted to ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for "content-based" and "graph-based" recommendation tasks, in which it took the first and third place respectively.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays Web sites tend to be more and more social: users can upload any kind of information on collaborative platforms and can express their opinions about the content they enjoyed through textual feedbacks or reviews. These platforms allow users to annotate resources they like through freely chosen keywords (called tags). The main advantage of these tools is that they perfectly fit user needs, since the use of tags allows organizing the information in a way that closely follows the user mental model, making retrieval of information easier. However, the heterogeneity characterizing the communities causes some problems in the activity of social tagging: someone annotates resources with very specific tags, other people with generic ones, and so on. These drawbacks reduce the exploitation of collaborative tagging systems for retrieval and filtering tasks. Therefore, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. The goal of these systems, called tag recommenders, is to suggest a set of relevant keywords for the resources to be annotated. This paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender system). Our system is based on two assumptions: 1) the more two or more resources are similar, the more they share common tags 2) a tag recommender should be able to exploit tags the user already used in order to extract useful keywords to label new resources. We also present an experimental evaluation carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy.},

Folksonomies present an attractive target for data mining applications such as tag recommenders. A challenge of tag recommendation remains the adaptation of traditional recommendation techniques originally designed to work with two dimensional data. To date the most successful recommenders have been graph based approaches which explicitly connects all three components of the folksonomy. In this paper we speculate that graph based tag recommendation can be improved by coupling it with item-based collaborative filtering. We motive this hypothesis with a discussion of informational channels in folksonomies and provide a theoretical explanation of the additive potential for item-based collaborative filtering. We then provided experimental results on hybrid tag recommenders built from graph models and other techniques based on popularity, user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. We demonstrate that a hybrid recommender built from a graph based model and item-based collaborative filtering outperforms its constituent recommenders. Furthermore the inability of the other recommenders to improve upon the graph-based approach suggests that they offer information already included in the graph based model. These results confirm our conjecture. We provide extensive evaluation of the hybrids using data collected from three real world collaborative tagging applications.},

  abstract      = {Folksonomies, otherwise known as Collaborative Tagging Systems, enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with user selected labels called tags. Tag recommendation, the suggestion of an ordered set of tags during the annotation process, reduces the user effort from a keyboard entry to a mouse click. By simplifying the annotation process tagging is promoted, noise in the data is reduced through the elimination of discrepancies that result in redundant tags, and ambiguous tags may be avoided. Tag recommenders can suggest tags that maximize utility, offer tags the user may not have previously considered or steer users toward adopting a core vocabulary. In sum, tag recommendation promotes a denser dataset that is useful in its own right or can be exploited by a myriad of data mining techniques for additional functionality. While there exists a long history of recommendation algorithms, the data structure of a Folksonomy is distinct from those found in traditional recommendation problems. We first explore two data reduction techniques, p-core processing and Hebbian deflation, then demonstrate how to adaptK-Nearest Neighbor for use with Folksonomies by incorporating user, resource and tag information into the algorithm. We further investigate multiple techniques for user modeling required to compute the similarity among users. Additionally we demonstrate that tag boosting, the promoting of tags previously applied by a user to a resource, improves the coverage and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor. These techniques are evaluated through extensive experimentation using data collected from two real Collaborative Tagging Web sites. Finally the modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is compared with alternative techniques based on popularity and link analysis. We find that K-Nearest Neighbor modified for use with Folksonomies generates excellent recommendations, scales well with large datasets, and is applicable to both narrow and broadly focused Folksonomies.

We performed two analyses of the sound collection. The first one is related with how the users tag the sounds, and we could detect some well-known problems that occur in collaborative tagging systems (i.e. polysemy, synonymy, and the scarcity of the existing annotations). Moreover, we show that more than 10% of the collection were scarcely annotated with only one or two tags per sound, thus frustrating the retrieval task. In this sense, the second analysis focuses on enhancing the semantic annotations of these sounds, by means of content- based audio similarity (autotagging). In order to "autotag" the sounds, we use a k-NN classifier that selects the available tags from the most similar sounds. Human assessment is performed in order to evaluate the perceived quality of the candidate tags. The results show that, in 77% of the sounds used, the annotations have been correctly extended with the proposed tags derived from audio similarity.},

A technique called SCM/THD investigated in this paper extracts entities from free-text annotations, and using the Lin similarity measure over the WordNet thesaurus classifies them into a controlled vocabulary of tags. Hypernyms extracted from Wikipedia are used to map uncommon entities to Wordnet synsets. In collaborative environments, users can assign multiple annotations to the same object hence increasing the amount of information available. Assuming that the semantics of the annotations overlap, this redundancy can be exploited to generate higher quality tags. A preliminary experiment presented in the paper evaluates the consistency and quality of tags generated from multiple annotations of the same image. The results obtained on an experimental dataset comprising of 62 annotations from four annotators show that the accuracy of a simple majority vote surpasses the average accuracy obtained through assessing the annotations individually by 18%. A moderate-strength correlation has been found between the quality of generated tags and the consistency of annotations.},

For an unlabeled image, we first retrieve its visual neighbors from a large user-tagged image database. We then select relevant tags from the result images to annotate the unlabeled image. To tackle the unreliability and sparsity of user tagging, we introduce a joint-modality tag relevance estimation method which efficiently addresses both textual and visual clues. Experiments on 1.5 million Flickr photos and 10 000 Corel images verify the proposed method.},

In this paper, we leverage user tags along with image content to infer the geo-location. Our model builds upon the fact that the visual content and user tags of pictures can provide significant hints about their geo-locations. Using a large collection of over a million geotagged photographs, we build location probability maps of user tags over the entire globe. These maps reflect the picture-taking and tagging behaviors of thousands of users from all over the world, and reveal interesting tag map patterns. Visual content matching is performed using multiple feature descriptors including tiny images, color histograms, GIST features, and bags of textons. The combination of visual content matching and local tag probability maps forms a strong geo-inference engine. Large-scale experiments have shown significant improvements over pure visual content-based geo-location inference.},

The main idea behind IHCT is that nonverbal behaviors displayed when interacting with multimedia data (e.g., facial expressions, head nods, etc.) provide information useful for improving the tag sets associated with the data. As such behaviors are displayed naturally and spontaneously, no effort is required from the users, and this is why the resulting tagging process is said to be "implicit". Tags obtained through IHCT are expected to be more robust than tags associated with the data explicitly, at least in terms of: generality (they make sense to everybody) and statistical reliability (all tags will be sufficiently represented). The paper discusses these issues in detail and provides an overview of pioneering efforts in the field.},

In this paper, we propose a novel automatic tag recommendation algorithm, which can be used in the large-scale and real-time data process effectively and efficiently. Most existing researches on tag suggestion focus on firstly mining the relationship between testing and training data and then assigning the top ranked tags of the most related training data to the testing object. However, they ignore the internal relationship between tags and weblogs. According to our research, more than 43% tags, which have been labeled by weblog users, have actually been used in the body of the text. At the meanwhile, the term frequency distribution, the paragraph frequency distribution and the first occurrence position of tags are very different from the ones of non-tags in the text. In this paper, the tags of a weblog are assigned in two steps. First of all, some probability distributions of the word attributes are trained by the labeled training weblogs, and some keywords of a testing weblog are extracted as one part of the tags based on the probability distributions. Then the other part of the tags are obtained from the first part ones with the help of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model. Experiments on a large-scale tagging dataset of weblogs 12 show that the average tagging time for a new weblog is less than 0.02 seconds, and over 74% testing weblogs are correctly labeled with the top 15 tags.},

The proposed approach complement these approaches by taking the temporal nature of interests of the user into account and enhancing his perception by analyzing and finding relationship among the tags associated to an object by him and other users.

  abstract        = {The advent of internet has led to a significant growth in the amount of information available, resulting in information overload, i.e. individuals have too much information to make a decision. To resolve this problem, collaborative tagging systems form a categorization called folksonomy in order to organize web resources. A folksonomy aggregates the results of personal free tagging of information and objects to form a categorization structure that applies utilizes the collective intelligence of crowds. Folksonomy is more appropriate for organizing huge amounts of information on the Web than traditional taxonomies established by expert cataloguers. However, the attributes of collaborative tagging systems and their folksonomy make them impractical for organizing resources in personal environments. This work designs a desktop collaborative tagging (DCT) system that enables collaborative workers to tag their documents. This work proposes an application in patent analysis based on the DCT system. Folksonomy in DCT is built by aggregating personal tagging results, and is represented by a concept space. Concept spaces provide synonym control, tag recommendation and relevant search. Additionally, to protect privacy of authors and to decrease the transmission cost, relations between tagged and untagged documents are constructed by extracting document's features rather than adopting the full text. Experimental results reveal that the adoption rate of recommended tags for new documents increases by 10% after users have tagged five or six documents. Furthermore, DCT can recommend tags with higher adoption rates when given new documents with similar topics to previously tagged ones. The relevant search in DCT is observed to be superior to keyword search when adopting frequently used tags as queries. The average precision, recall, and F-measure of DCT are 12.12%, 23.08%, and 26.92% higher than those of keyword searching. DCT allows a multi-faceted categorization of resources for collaborative workers and recommends tags for categorizing resources to simplify categorization easier. Additionally, DCT system provides relevance searching, which is more effective than traditional keyword searching for searching personal resources. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

Transfer learning has received more attention in recent years, because this technique is considered to be helpful in reducing the cost of labeling. In this paper, we propose a very simple approach to transfer learning: TrBagg, which is the extension of bagging. TrBagg is composed of two stages: Many weak classifiers are first generated as in standard bagging, and these classifiers are then filtered based on their usefulness for the target task. This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract      = {Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords, to annotate and categorize items (songs, pictures, Web links, products, etc.). Social tagging systems (STSs) can provide three different types of recommendations: They can recommend 1) tags to users, based on what tags other users have used for the same items, 2) items to users, based on tags they have in common with other similar users, and 3) users with common social interest, based on common tags on similar items. However, users may have different interests for an item, and items may have multiple facets. In contrast to the current recommendation algorithms, our approach develops a unified framework to model the three types of entities that exist in a social tagging system: users, items, and tags. These data are modeled by a 3-order tensor, on which multiway latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) method and the kernel-SVD smoothing technique. We perform experimental comparison of the proposed method against state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms with two real data sets (Last.fm and BibSonomy). Our results show significant improvements in terms of effectiveness measured through recall/precision.},

In this paper, we investigate techniques which allow effective annotation of web videos from a data-driven perspective. A novel classifier-free video annotation framework is proposed by first retrieving visual duplicates and then suggesting representative tags. The significance of this paper lies in the addressing of two timely issues for annotating query videos. First, we provide a novel solution for fast near-duplicate video retrieval. Second, based on the outcome of near-duplicate search, we explore the potential that the data-driven annotation could be successful when huge volume of tagged web videos is freely accessible online. Experiments on cross sources (annotating Google videos and Yahoo! videos using YouTube videos) and cross time periods (annotating YouTube videos using historical data) show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed classifier-free approach for web video tag annotation.},

Discovering the correlations among different tags can significantly help predicting precise labels for videos and images. Many of recent studies toward multi-label learning construct a linear subspace embedding with encoded multi-label information, such that data points sharing many common labels tend to be close to each other in the embedded subspace. Motivated by the advances of compressive sensing research, a sparse representation that selects a compact subset to describe the input data can be more discriminative. In this paper, we propose a sparse multi-label learning method to circumvent the visually polysemous barrier of multiple tags. Our approach learns a multi-label encoded sparse linear embedding space from a related dataset, and maps the target data into the learned new representation space to achieve better annotation performance. Instead of using l1-norm penalty (lasso) to induce sparse representation, we propose to formulate the multi-label learning as a penalized least squares optimization problem with elastic-net penalty. By casting the video concept detection and image annotation tasks into a sparse multi-label transfer learning framework in this paper, ridge regression, lasso, elastic net, and the multi-label extended sparse discriminant analysis methods are, respectively, well explored and compared.},

  abstract      = {Tag recommendation is an integral part of any bookmarking application. With the growing popularity in Web 2.0 usage, recommending tags is of utmost importance in enabling a user to perform bookmarking easily. An issue that most recommendation systems do not consider is that users have a tendency to choose from tags that are suggested to them, which might bias the true popular rankings of tags. In this paper we consider the problem of tag recommendation for bookmarks based on user feedback. We propose an approach for automatic tag recommendation by using a suggestion set and discuss a randomized suggestion rule for learning the true popular tags. As our algorithm depends on the frequency of tag suggestions, the action of spammers and malicious users may result in skewed ranking of tags for a bookmark. Hence, there arises a need to identify malicious users and spam posts to reinforce the efficiency of our algorithm because spammers can easily mislead a system. We have proposed an approach for classifying spammers based on tagging history of users. Our approach basically estimates the probability of a user being a spammer by analyzing previous posts and tags. Our analysis on a dataset of a popular bookmarking site shows that the proposed method is effective in suggesting the true popular tags and identifying spammers.},

Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.},

Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user.

To include candidate tags beyond the existing vocabularies of the query resource and of the query user, we examine recommendation methods that are based on personomy translation, and propose a probabilistic framework for adopting translations from similar users (neighbors). We propose to use distributional divergence to measure the similarity between users in the context of personomy translation, and examine two variations of such divergence (similarity) measures. We evaluate the proposed framework on a benchmark dataset collected from BibSonomy, and compare with two groups of baseline methods: (i) personomy translation methods based solely on the query user; and (ii) collaborative filtering. The experimental results show that our neighbor based translation methods outperform these baseline methods significantly. Moreover, we show that adopting translations from neighbors indeed helps including more relevant tags than that based solely on the query user.},

It is important for many web-sites with tagging capabilities like “delicious” or “flickr”. These social tagging systems usually include tag recommendation mechanism which assist users in tagging process by suggesting relevant tags to them, where tag recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized list of tags for a user given an item. In this paper, we propose an approach for tag recommendation based on users' interest lattice matching (UILM). UILM constructs the users' interest lattice according to users' interest context extracted from tagging data. Lattice Matching is then proposed and applied to obtain the users that are similar to the current user. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach through experiments.},

Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing ef-ficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems conffrmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system eficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging allows users to assign arbitrary keywords (or tags) describing the content of objects, which facilitates navigation and improves searching without dependence on pre-configured categories. In large-scale tag-based systems, tag recommendation services can assist a user in the assignment of tags to objects and help consolidate the vocabulary of tags across users. A promising approach for tag recommendation is to exploit the co-occurrence of tags. However, these methods are challenged by the huge size of the tag vocabulary, either because (1) the computational complexity may increase exponentially with the number of tags or (2) the score associated with each tag may become distorted since different tags may operate in different scales and the scores are not directly comparable. In this paper we propose a novel method that recommends tags on a demand-driven basis according to an initial set of tags applied to an object. It reduces the space of possible solutions, so that its complexity increases polynomially with the size of the tag vocabulary. Further, the score of each tag is calibrated using an entropy minimization approach which corrects possible distortions and provides more precise recommendations. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using three types of media: audio, bookmarks and video. The experimental results show that the proposed method is fast and boosts recommendation quality on different experimental scenarios. For instance, in the case of a popular audio site it provides improvements in precision (p@5) ranging from 6.4% to 46.7% (depending on the number of tags given as input), outperforming a recently proposed co-occurrence based tag recommendation method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Tags describe the contents of the resource or provide additional contextual and semantical information to make the content more easily browsable and discoverable by others.

In this paper we show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social comment network. We analyze a representative snapshot of Flickr and construct comment networks that present the user clusters in which users add comments to the central user's photos. We find similar users with common interests based on K-Nearest Neighbor and present tag recommendation strategy in local comment context.

The rapid growth of shared information mostly controlled by social tags poses a new challenge for social tag-based information organization and retrieval. A plausible approach for this challenge is linking social tags to a controlled vocabulary. As an introductory step for this approach, this study investigates ways of predicting relevant subject headings for resources from social tags assigned to the resources. The prediction of subject headings was measured by five different similarity measures: tf-idf, cosine-based similarity (CoS), Jaccard similarity (or Jaccard coefficient; JS), Mutual information (MI), and information radius (IRad). Their results were compared to those by professionals. The results show that a CoS measure based on top five social tags was most effective. Inclusions of more social tags only aggravate the performance. The performance of JS is comparable to the performance of CoS while tf-idf is comparable with up to 70% less than the best performance. MI and IRad have inferior performance compared to the other methods. This study demonstrates the application of the similarity measuring techniques to the prediction of correct Library of Congress subject headings. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

In view of this, this paper proposes a new knowledge propagation scheme to automatically propagate keywords from a subset of annotated images to the unannotated ones. The main idea is based on image content analysis and training of keyword classifiers. An evolutionary scheme is utilized to find the salient regions in the annotated images, and the importance of the other regions is estimated using one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). An ensemble of variable-length radial basis function (VLRBF)-based classifiers is trained based on the visual features of the annotated images. The trained classifiers are then used for knowledge propagation.

  abstract        = {Thanks to the continuous growth of collaborative platforms like YouTube, Flickr and Delicious, we are recently witnessing to a rapid evolution of web dynamics towards a more 'social' vision, called Web 2.0. In this context collaborative tagging systems are rapidly emerging as one of the most promising tools. However, as tags are handled in a simply syntactical way, collaborative tagging systems suffer of typical Information Retrieval (IR) problems like polysemy and synonymy: so, in order to reduce the impact of these drawbacks and to aid at the same time the so-called tag convergence, systems that assist the user in the task of tagging are required. In this paper we present a system, called STaR, that implements an IR-based approach for tag recommendation. Our approach, mainly based on the exploitation of a state-of-the-art IR-model called BM25, relies on two assumptions: firstly, if two or more resources share some common patterns (e.g. the same features in the textual description), we can exploit this information supposing that they could be annotated with similar tags. Furthermore, since each user has a typical manner to label resources, a tag recommender might exploit this information to weigh more the tags she already used to annotate similar resources. We also present an experimental evaluation, carried out using a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy. Copyright owned by the authors.},

  abstract        = {Social media systems have encouraged end user participation in the Internet, for the purpose of storing and distributing Internet content, sharing opinions and maintaining relationships. Collaborative tagging allows users to annotate the resulting user-generated content, and enables effective retrieval of otherwise uncategorised data. However, compared to professional web content production, collaborative tagging systems face the challenge that end-users assign tags in an uncontrolled manner, resulting in unsystematic and inconsistent metadata. This paper introduces a framework for the personalization of social media systems. We pinpoint three tasks that would benefit from personalization: collaborative tagging, collaborative browsing and collaborative search. We propose a ranking model for each task that integrates the individual user's tagging history in the recommendation of tags and content, to align its suggestions to the individual user preferences. We demonstrate on two real data sets that for all three tasks, the personalized ranking should take into account both the user's own preference and the opinion of others. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract      = {Unlimited vocabulary annotation of multimedia documents remains elusive despite progress solving the problem in the case of a small, fixed lexicon. Taking advantage of the repetitive nature of modern information and online media databases with independent annotation instances, we present an approach to automatically annotate multimedia documents that uses mining techniques to discover new annotations from similar documents and to filter existing incorrect annotations. The annotation set is not limited to words that have training data or for which models have been created. It is limited only by the words in the collective annotation vocabulary of all the database documents. A graph reinforcement method driven by a particular modality (e.g., visual) is used to determine the contribution of a similar document to the annotation target. The graph supplies possible annotations of a different modality (e.g., text) that can be mined for annotations of the target. Experiments are performed using videos crawled from YouTube. A customized precision-recall metric shows that the annotations obtained using the proposed method are superior to those originally existing for the document. These extended, filtered tags are also superior to a state-of-the-art semi-supervised technique for graph reinforcement learning on the initial user-supplied annotations.},

State-of-art user modeling approaches in tagging systems usually use a vector of weighted tags. Unfortunately, typical user modeling methods using a vector of weighted tags which are based on personal view only and ignore the social view, have some inherent drawbacks. As in a social network like collaborative tagging system, it is subjective and incomplete to profile using only personal view. In this paper, a novel approach applying association rules is proposed to extend user profiles from the social view. The enriched user profile is a harvest from both personal view and social view. Algorithms of personalized recommendations for tags and items are presented. Also experimental results of using the profile we proposed are discussed. ©2010 IEEE.},

However, these tags are often imprecise and incomplete, which essentially limits tag-based image indexing and related applications. To tackle this issue, we propose an image retagging scheme that aims at refining the quality of the tags. The retagging process is formulated as a multiple graph-based multi-label learning problem, which simultaneously explores the visual content of the images, semantic correlation of the tags as well as the prior information provided by users. Different from classical single graph-based multi-label learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm propagates the information of each tag along an individual tag-specific similarity graph, which reflects the particular relationship among the images with respect to the specific tag and at the same time the propagations of different tags interact with each other in a collaborative way with an extra tag similarity graph. In particular, we present a robust tag-specific visual sub-vocabulary learning algorithm for the construction of those tag-specific graphs. Experimental results on two benchmark Flickr image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed image retagging scheme. We also show the remarkable performance improvements brought by retagging in the task of image ranking.},

Since social tags are usually as signed by people with different levels of musical knowledge, they inevitably contain noisy information. By treating the tag counts as costs, we can model the audio tagging problem as a cost-sensitive classification problem. In addition, tag correlation is another useful information for automatic audio tagging since some tags often co-occur. By considering the co-occurrences of tags, we can model the audio tagging problem as a multi-label classification problem. To exploit the tag count and correlation information jointly, we formulate the audio tagging task as a novel cost-sensitive multi-label (CSML) learning problem. The results of audio tag annotation and retrieval experiments demonstrate that the new approach outperforms our MIREX 2009 winning method.},

In the submission to ISMIR'07, Mohamed Sordo proposed a novel model, i.e., propagation of labels, to annotate music with existing labels, by using the content-based music similarity distance. In that model, a partially annotated collection with a lot of non-labeled music was annotated at a high precision and recall. In this paper, we proposed a new model -- label probability prediction model -- and introduce it into the Sordo's work, which makes a combined model, to improve the accuracy of propagation without exploiting any other information. In addition, we also made some modifications to the original Sordo's model that could make the algorithm works better. Then we compare the result of combined model to that yielded by the original on a publicly accessible ground truth data, and find that, the new approach can reach a higher recall. Furthermore, with the same recall, our method obtains a better precision.},

In this paper, a novel approach to automatically refine the image tags is proposed. Firstly, information entropy of the tag is defined to refine tag frequency to predict tag initial relevance. Then, tag correlation is calculated from two sides. One side is to measure semantic similarity of tag pairs using the structured information of the free encyclopedia Wikipedia. The other one is to compute the visual similarity of tag pairs based on the visual representation of the tag. Finally, to re-rank the original tags, a fast random walk with restart is used and the top ones are reserved as the final tags. Experimental results conducted on dataset NUS-WIDE demonstrate the promising effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract      = {Automatic music tagging is addressed by resorting to auditory temporal modulations and Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). The starting point is to represent each music recording by its auditory temporal modulations. Then, an irregular third order tensor is formed. The first slice contains the vectorized training temporal modulations, while the second slice contains the corresponding multi-label vectors. The PARAFAC2 is employed to effectively harness the multi-label information for dimensionality reduction. Any vectorized test auditory representation of temporal modulations is first projected onto the semantic space derived via the PARAFAC2 and the coefficient vector is obtained. Then, the annotation vector is obtained by multiplying this coefficient vector by the left singular vectors of the second slice (i.e., the slice associated to the label vector). The proposed framework, outperforms the state-of-the-art auto-tagging systems, when applied to the CAL500 dataset in a 10-fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

In order to generate more flexible and socialized tags, we expand keywords and their bigrams by exploring tag associations mined from a famous bookmarking web del.icio.us. Finally we rank the three parts of tag candidates under a uniform metric. Unlike previous models used for tag recommendation task, our model needs neither seed tags for source texts nor a complete tag set. It can recommend new tags out of the historical tag set.

A set of descriptive tags has to be manually entered by users whenever they post a resource. This process can be simplified by the use of tag recommendation systems. Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the system's ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development. © 2011 ACM.},

Existing systems have utilized only ternary relationships such as users-items-ratings, or users-items-tags to derive their recommendations. In this paper, we show that ternary relationships are insufficient to provide accurate recommendations. Instead, we model the quaternary relationship among users, items, tags and ratings as a 4-order tensor and cast the recommendation problem as a multi-way latent semantic analysis problem. A unified framework for user recommendation, item recommendation, tag recommendation and item rating prediction is proposed. The results of extensive experiments performed on a real world dataset demonstrate that our unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in all the four recommendation tasks.},

We decompose the real world multi-class problems such as semantic categorization or automatic tagging into a set of tasks where each task corresponds to several classes with strong visual correlation. We conduct metric learning to learn a set of (hyper)category-specific metrics for all the tasks. By encouraging model sharing among tasks, more generalization power is acquired. Another advantage is the capability of simultaneous learning with semantic information and social tagging based on the multi-task learning framework, and thus they both benefit from the information provided by each other. Experiments demonstrate the advantages on applications including semantic categorization and automatic tagging compared with other popular metric learning approaches.},

Motivated by the observation that media contents are usually shared frequently in online communities and thus have a lot of social diffusion records, we propose a novel media annotating approach depending on these social diffusion records instead of metadata. The basic assumption is that the social diffusion records reflect the common interests (CI) between users, which can be analyzed for generating annotations. With this assumption, we present a novel CI-based social diffusion model and translate the automatic annotating task into the CI-based diffusion maximization (CIDM) problem. Moreover, we propose to solve the CIDM problem through two optimization tasks, corresponding to the training and test stages in supervised learning. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our approach can effectively generate high quality annotations, and thus demonstrate the capability of social diffusion analysis in annotating media.},

These user-generated tags can represent users' interests more concise and closer to human understanding. Interests will change over time. Thus, how to describe users' interests and interests transfer path become a big challenge for personalized recommendation systems. In this approach, we propose a variable-length time interval division algorithm and user interest model based on time interval. Then, in order to draw users' interests transfer path over a specific time period, we suggest interest transfer model. After that, we apply a classical community partition algorithm in our approach to separate users into communities. Finally, we raise a novel method to measure users' similarities based on interest transfer model and provide personalized tag recommendation according to similar users' interests in their next time intervals. Experimental results demonstrate the higher precision and recall with our approach than classical user-based collaborative filtering methods.},

We propose a multi-mode recommendation algorithm based on higher-order singular value decomposition, and our algorithm handles not only the existing triplets {user, item, tag}, but also the pairs {user, item} with no tags in social tagging system. Meanwhile. We propose a measure for user recommendations. We empirically show that our algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm for multi-mode recommendations with a Last.fm dataset.},

The potential of very subtle yet important emergent semantics hidden in such environments calls for equally elegant and powerful methods to "mine" them. However, much of the previous work on model based recommender systems for folksonomies considered user to resource and resource to tag similarity separately, ignoring the dependency of users' interest to both the tags and the corresponding resources. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic personalized recommendation model, Latent Interest Model, that accounts for users, tags and resources jointly. The proposed method's performance is evaluated on real data sets obtained from a popular online bookmarking site using different performance measures for tag and resource recommendation tasks. Our experimental results show that our model captures personal preferences for tag usage and resource selection. Performance evaluation of Latent Interest Model indicates that the proposed personalized method yields significant improvement of recommendation accuracy.},

However, most visual effects are generated by audio signal processing directly and render meaningless or incomprehensible displays to users. In this paper, we present an intelligent music player called the Playing with Tagging (PWT) music player. By integrating a real-time music tagger, the PWT player can display dynamic tag distributions via a set of tag bars that move in sync with the music. To synchronize the tag distributions, the music tagger must be able to online recognize the music tags. We utilize a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as an auditory feature encoding reference and a mixture of tag-based aspect models (TBAMs) to predict the tag distribution for a short sliding chunk of the music played. To evaluate the real-time tagging function, we simulate tag prediction on short music chunks.

Typical solutions to this problem require analysis of the correlation among different attributes of the photos, including the correlation between the textual features and visual features computed from a photo. However, most on-line photos have very few tags or even no tags, and thus they contribute little or none to the analysis of tag-photo correlation, which is a key component in those schemes that rely on such analysis for tag recommendation. To address this practical challenge, we propose an active learning method for incorporating photos with no or few tags so as to enhance the correlation analysis for improved performance in tag recommendation.

Indeed, although contextual relationships correlate tags, many auto-taggers model tags independently. This paper presents a novel, generative approach to improve automatic music annotation by modeling contextual relationships between tags. A Dirichlet mixture model (DMM) is proposed as a second, additional stage in the modeling process, to supplement any auto-tagging system that generates a semantic multinomial (SMN) over a vocabulary of tags when annotating a song. For each tag in the vocabulary, a DMM captures the broader context the tag defines by modeling tag co-occurrence patterns in the SMNs of songs associated with the tag. When annotating songs, the DMMs refine SMN annotations by leveraging contextual evidence. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of combining a variety of auto-taggers with this generative context model. It generally outperforms other approaches to modeling context as well.},

Given a set of training music recordings represented by the tag-music recording matrix having zero-one (indicator) vectors of the tags associated with each recording in its columns along with the matrix of the ATM representations in its columns, a low-rank weight matrix is sought, such that the tag-music recording matrix is expressed as the product of the weight matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations plus an error matrix. Clearly, such a weight matrix captures the relationships between the labels (i.e., tags) and the audio features. It can be derived by solving a convex nuclear norm minimization problem, if the tag-music recording matrix and the matrix of the ATM representations are assumed to be jointly low-rank. Having found the weight matrix, the annotation vector for labeling any test music recording can be obtained by multiplying the weight matrix with its ATM representation. The just outlined method is referred to as low-rank representation based multi-label annotation (LRRMA). The LRRMA outperforms the state-of-the-art auto-tagging systems, when applied to the CAL500 dataset in a 5-fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

  abstract      = {The availability of large quantities of user contributed images with labels has provided opportunities to develop automatic tools to tag images to facilitate image search and retrieval. This paper discusses about an approach for automatic annotation in digital images. Some of the previous models for automatic image annotations are translation model (TM), continuous-space relevance model (CRM) and multiple Bernoulli relevance model (MBRM).These models have some semantic gap problems. To avoid these problems here developed a hybrid probabilistic model (HPM) which is used to combine both low-level image features and user provided tags to automatically tag images. For images without any tags, HPM predicts new tags based on the low-level image features. Low-level features are color, texture and shape. For images with user provided tags, HPM use both the image features and the tags to recommend additional tags to label the images. Here a Colored Pattern Appearance Model (CPAM) is used to capture both color and texture information. An L1 norm kernel method is used to estimate the correlations between image features and semantic concepts. The kernel density estimation is accelerated by an Improved Fast Gauss transform(IFGT).When the number of images becomes larger then Tag-Image Association Matrix (TIAM) used in the HPM framework become very sparse, thus it is very difficult to estimate tag-to-tag co-occurrence probabilities. So a collaborative filtering method based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is used for tackling this data sparsity issue. Here a CF algorithm is used to find the correlation between the words. Building such a HPM will make image labelling more efficient and less labour intensive.},

There is such a common phenomenon that certain tag does not appear in the corresponding description, however, they do semantically relate with each other. State-of-the-art methods seldom consider this phenomenon and thus still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel content-based social tag ranking scheme, aiming to recommend the semantic tags that the descriptions may not contain. The scheme firstly acquires the quantized semantic relationships between words with empirical methods, then constructs the weighted tag-digraph based on the descriptions and acquired quantized semantics, and finally performs a modified graph-based ranking algorithm to refine the score of each candidate tag for recommendation. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed scheme performs better than several state-of-the-art content-based methods.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging has emerged as an efficient way to semantically describe online resources shared by a community of users. However, tag descriptions present some drawbacks such as tag scarcity or concept inconsistencies. In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140, 000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we find that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically significant improvements. Moreover, we show how specific strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve algorithms' performance. These two aspects provide insight into some of the most basic components of tag recommendation systems, and we plan to exploit them in future real-world deployments. © 2012 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

  abstract      = {Tagging has become increasingly popular with the explosion of user-created content on the web. A 'tag' can be defined as a group of keywords that makes organizing, browsing and searching for content more efficient. Users apply tags to a variety of web-based, shareable content including photos, videos, news articles, bookmarks, friends, etc. Tag suggestions for blog posts or web-pages have changed the focus of the tagging process from generation to recognition, thus making it less time and effort intensive. We propose tag recommendation algorithms for personalized agents, that recommend tags for bookmarks stored in a popular social bookmarking website, Del.ici.ous [6]. Our tag recommender agents learn to classify the tags according to their semantic similarity based on collaborative tagging by the users. Hence this approach can be used to facilitate folksonomy formation for the social network. In this paper, we first empirically verify our hypothesis that web pages with similar content are tagged with similar tags. We compare both Content-based and Collaborative approaches to recommend tags to the users. We analyze the performance of two probabilistic approaches to recommend tags from users with similar tagging behavior. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

  abstract        = {Due to the explosive growth of the Web, the domain of Web personalization has gained great momentum both in the research and commercial areas. One of the most popular web personalization systems is recommender systems. In recommender systems choosing user information that can be used to profile users is very crucial for user profiling. In Web 2.0, one facility that can help users organize Web resources of their interest is user tagging systems. Exploring user tagging behavior provides a promising way for understanding users' information needs since tags are given directly by users. However, free and relatively uncontrolled vocabulary makes the user self-defined tags lack of standardization and semantic ambiguity. Also, the relationships among tags need to be explored since there are rich relationships among tags which could provide valuable information for us to better understand users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning tag ontology based on the widely used lexical database WordNet for capturing the semantics and the structural relationships of tags. We present personalization strategies to disambiguate the semantics of tags by combining the opinion of WordNet lexicographers and users' tagging behavior together. To personalize further, clustering of users is performed to generate a more accurate ontology for a particular group of users. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the tag ontology, we use the tag ontology in a pilot tag recommendation experiment for improving the recommendation performance by exploiting the semantic information in the tag ontology. The initial result shows that the personalized information has improved the accuracy of the tag recommendation. © 2012 ACM.},

As the large majority of users enters only very few tags, good tag recommendation can vastly improve the usability of tags for techniques such as searching, indexing, and clustering. Previous research has shown that accurate recommendation can be achieved by using conditional probabilities computed from tag associations. The main problem, however, is that enormous amounts of associations are needed for optimal recommendation. We argue and demonstrate that pattern selection techniques can improve tag recommendation by giving a very favourable balance between accuracy and computational demand. That is, few associations are chosen to act as information source for recommendation, providing high-quality recommendation and good scalability at the same time. We provide a proof-of-concept using an off-the-shelf pattern selection method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Experiments on data from Delicious, LastFM and YouTube show that our proposed methodology works well: applying pattern selection gives a very favourable trade-off between runtime and recommendation quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Tags can support web service understanding, categorizing and discovering, which are important tasks in a service-oriented software system. However, most of existing web services' tags are annotated manually. Manual tagging is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tag web services automatically. Our approach consists of two tagging strategies, tag enriching and tag extraction. In the first strategy, we cluster web services using WSDL documents, and then we enrich tags for a service with the tags of other services in the same cluster. Considering our approach may not generate enough tags by tag enriching, we also extract tags from WSDL documents and related descriptions in the second step. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, a series of experiments are carried out based on web-scale web services. The experimental results show that our tagging method is effective, ensuring the number and quality of generated tags. We also show how to use tagging results to improve the performance of a web service search engine, which can prove that our work in this paper is useful and meaningful.},

These systems achieved widespread success on the Web on account of the simplicity for organizing resources using open-ended tags. Recently, tag recommendation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problems of ambiguity, syntactic variations and noise in tags cause by the inherent characteristics of natural language. In this work we proposed a content-based approach that generates a list of suggested tags for annotating a given resource starting from an analysis of its textual content exclusively. Thus, the proposed method can be used in situations in which there is not enough information for creating a tag-based user profile or compare the user with others. For extracting the more relevant words different term weighting approaches were evaluated, particularly considering the HTML structure of Web pages and the grammatical category of words in order to determine promising tag candidates. Experimental results of applying this technique to tag recommendation using several term weighting approaches are reported and compared.},

However, a significant amount of travel images on the Internet lack proper geographical annotations or tags. In many cases, the images are tagged manually. One way to make this time-consuming manual tagging process more efficient is to propagate tags from a small set of tagged images to the larger set of untagged images automatically. In this paper, we present a system for automatic geotag propagation in images based on the similarity between image content (famous landmarks) and its context (associated geotags). In such a scenario, however, an incorrect or a spam tag can damage the integrity and reliability of the automated propagation system. Therefore, for reliable geotags propagation, we suggest adopting a user trust model based on social feedback from the users of the photo-sharing system. We compare this socially-driven approach with other user trust models via experiments and subjective testing on an image database of various famous landmarks. Results demonstrate that relying on user feedback is more efficient, since the number of propagated tags more than doubles without loss of accuracy compared to using other models or propagating without trust modeling.},

We refer to these kinds of online media which help software engineers improve their performance in software development, maintenance and test processes as software information sites. It is common to see tags in software information sites and many sites allow users to tag various objects with their own words. Users increasingly use tags to describe the most important features of their posted contents or projects. In this paper, we propose TagCombine, an automatic tag recommendation method which analyzes objects in software information sites. TagCombine has 3 different components: 1. multilabel ranking component which considers tag recommendation as a multi-label learning problem; 2. similarity based ranking component which recommends tags from similar objects; 3. tag-term based ranking component which considers the relationship between different terms and tags, and recommends tags after analyzing the terms in the objects. We evaluate TagCombine on 2 software information sites, StackOverflow and Freecode, which contain 47,668 and 39,231 text documents, respectively, and 437 and 243 tags, respectively. Experiment results show that for StackOverflow, our TagCombine achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.5964 and 0.7239, respectively; For Freecode, it achieves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.6391 and 0.7773, respectively. Moreover, averaging over StackOverflow and Freecode results, we improve TagRec proposed by Al-Kofahi et al. by 22.65% and 14.95%, and the tag recommendation method proposed by Zangerle et al. by 18.5% and 7.35% for recall@5 and recall@10 scores.},

  abstract      = {In the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of document data with rich tag information during the evolution of the Internet, which can be called semi-structured data. These semi-structured data contain both unstructured features (e.g., plain text) and metadata, such as tags in html files or author and venue information in research articles. It's of great interest to model such kind of data. Most previous works focused on modeling the unstructured data. Some other methods have been proposed to model the unstructured data with specific tags. To build a general model for semi-structured documents remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model the tagged documents by a so-called Tag-Weighted Dirichlet Allocation (TWDA). TWDA is a framework that leverages both the tags and words in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e.g., classification, clustering, and recommendations). Moreover, TWDA can automatically infer the probabilistic weights of tags for each document, that can be used to predict the tags in one document. We present an efficient variational inference method with an EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental results show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of our TWDA approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art methods on four corpora in document modeling, tags prediction and text classification.},

  abstract      = {Social tagging has grown in popularity on the web due to its effectiveness in organizing and accessing web pages. This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG10 improvement separately.},

  abstract        = {As social media sites grow in popularity, tagging has naturally emerged as a method of searching, categorizing and filtering online information, especially multimedia content. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content however, has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. This paper is concerned with investigating generative models of social annotations, and testing their efficiency with respect to two information consumption oriented tasks. One task considers recommending new tags (similarly new resources) for new, previously unknown users. We use perplexity as a standard measure for estimating the generalization performance of a probabilistic model. The second task is aimed at recommending new users to connect with. In this task, we examine which users' activity is most discriminative in predicting social ties: annotation (i.e. tags), resource usage (i.e. artists), or collective annotation of resources altogether. For the second task, we propose a framework to integrate the modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users. In particular, we propose four classification schemes for social link recommendation, which we evaluate on a real-world dataset from Last.fm. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

However, collaborative tagging systems typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. As a result, the organisation and browsing of tagged content is far from being optimal. In this work the authors present a general scheme for building a folksonomy-based tag recommendation system to help users tagging online content resources. Based on this general scheme, the authorse describe eight tag recommendation methods and extensively evaluate them with data coming from two real-world large-scale datasets of tagged images and sound clips. Their results show that the proposed methods can effectively recommend relevant tags, given a set of input tags and tag co-occurrence information. Moreover, the authors show how novel strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve methods performances. Approaches such as the one presented here can be useful to obtain more comprehensive and coherent descriptions of tagged resources, thus allowing a better organisation, browsing and reuse of online content. Moreover, they can increase the value of folksonomies as reliable sources for knowledge-mining. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems are now deployed extensively to help users share and organize resources. Tag prediction and recommendation can simplify and streamline the user experience, and by modeling user preferences, predictive accuracy can be significantly improved. However, previous methods typically model user behavior based only on a log of prior tags, neglecting other behaviors and information in social tagging systems, e.g., commenting on items and connecting with other users. On the other hand, little is known about the connection and correlations among these behaviors and contexts in social tagging systems. In this paper, we investigate improved modeling for predictive social tagging systems. Our explanatory analyses demonstrate three significant challenges: coupled high order interaction, data sparsity and cold start on items. We tackle these problems by using a generalized latent factor model and fully Bayesian treatment. To evaluate performance, we test on two real-world data sets from Flickr and Bibsonomy. Our experiments on these data sets show that to achieve best predictive performance, it is necessary to employ a fully Bayesian treatment in modeling high order relations in social tagging system. Our methods noticeably outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 ACM.},

  abstract        = {The rapid growth of the so-called Web 2.0 has changed the surfers' behavior. A new democratic vision emerged, in which users can actively contribute to the evolution of the Web by producing new content or enriching the existing one with user generated metadata. In this context the use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for describing and organizing resources, spread as a model for browsing and retrieving web contents. The success of that collaborative model is justified by two factors: firstly, information is organized in a way that closely reflects the users' mental model; secondly, the absence of a controlled vocabulary reduces the users' learning curve and allows the use of evolving vocabularies. Since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness for complex tasks. Consequently, tag recommenders, with their ability of providing users with the most suitable tags for the resources to be annotated, recently emerged as a way of speeding up the process of tag convergence. The contribution of this work is a tag recommender system implementing both a collaborative and a content-based recommendation technique. The former exploits the user and community tagging behavior for producing recommendations, while the latter exploits some heuristics to extract tags directly from the textual content of resources. Results of experiments carried out on a dataset gathered from Bibsonomy show that hybrid recommendation strategies can outperform single ones and the way of combining them matters for obtaining more accurate results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In this paper we propose a recommendation algorithm, called Fas Tag, that links the relevance of the tags to both their popularity and the opinions of the user's neighbors. Fas Tag assumes that the users are organized in a weighted graph representing, for instance, the similarity or the trust between them. The two salient aspects of Fas Tag are the scoring function it uses to evaluate the relevance of the tags, and its low computation cost. Thus, Fas Tag can make online recommendations, even for large datasets. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of its recommendations by adjusting automatically the size of the recommended list of tags. The experiments we did on several datasets show a significant improvement of the accuracy of the recommendations.},

From the system's perspective, hashtags play an important role in tweet retrieval, event detection, topic tracking, and advertising, etc. Annotating tweets with the right hashtags can lead to a better user experience. However, two problems remain unsolved during an annotation: (1) Before the user decides to create a new hashtag, is there any way to help her/him find out whether some related hashtags have already been created and widely used? (2) Different users may have different preferences for categorizing tweets. However, few work has been done to study the personalization issue in hashtag recommendation. To address the above problems, we propose a statistical model for personalized hashtag recommendation in this paper. With millions of <;tweet, hashtag> pairs being published everyday, we are able to learn the complex mappings from tweets to hashtags with the wisdom of the crowd. Two questions are answered in the model: (1) Different from traditional item recommendation data, users and tweets in Twitter have rich auxiliary information like URLs, mentions, locations, social relations, etc. How can we incorporate these features for hashtag recommendation? (2) Different hashtags have different temporal characteristics. Hashtags related to breaking events in the physical world have strong rise-and-fall temporal pattern while some other hashtags remain stable in the system. How can we incorporate hashtag related features to serve for hashtag recommendation? With all the above factors considered, we show that our model successfully outperforms existing methods on real datasets crawled from Twitter.},

  abstract      = {Social tagging becomes increasingly important to organize and search large-scale community-contributed photos on social websites. To facilitate generating high-quality social tags, tag recommendation by automatically assigning relevant tags to photos draws particular research interest. In this paper, we focus on the personalized tag recommendation task and try to identify user-preferred, geo-location-specific as well as semantically relevant tags for a photo by leveraging rich contexts of the freely available community-contributed photos. For users and geo-locations, we assume they have different preferred tags assigned to a photo, and propose a subspace learning method to individually uncover the both types of preferences. The goal of our work is to learn a unified subspace shared by the visual and textual domains to make visual features and textual information of photos comparable. Considering the visual feature is a lower level representation on semantics than the textual information, we adopt a progressive learning strategy by additionally introducing an intermediate subspace for the visual domain, and expect it to have consistent local structure with the textual space. Accordingly, the unified subspace is mapped from the intermediate subspace and the textual space respectively. We formulate the above learning problems into a united form, and present an iterative optimization with its convergence proof. Given an untagged photo with its geo-location to a user, the user-preferred and the geo-location-specific tags are found by the nearest neighbor search in the corresponding unified spaces. Then we combine the obtained tags and the visual appearance of the photo to discover the semantically and visually related photos, among which the most frequent tags are used as the recommended tags. Experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Flickr verify the effectivity of the proposed solution.},

The expansion coefficients are learned to minimize the global error between the prediction and the ground truth. We derive an analytic solution to learn the coefficients efficiently. We further extend this model to handle the cost-sensitive multi-label classification problem, and apply it in social tagging to handle the issue of the noisy training set by treating the tag counts as the misclassification costs. We have conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets and compared our method with other state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods.

Most of the existing annotation methods rely on content-based approach to annotation, whose effectiveness is restricted due to the semantic gap between low-level features and semantic annotations, as well as the irrelevance between annotations and image content. Recently, social media analysis has been investigated for image annotation. Inspired by the abundant social diffusion records of images in online social networks, we propose a novel image annotation approach based on social diffusion analysis. We present a common-interest model to interpret social diffusion, i.e. different images have different social diffusion routes due to the preferences of users, and such preferences are represented as common interests of pairwise users rather than personalized interests. We propose an image annotation framework that consists of learning of common interests, feature extraction from social diffusion records, and automatic annotation by learning to rank. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms content-based and user-preference-based annotation methods.},

Images, videos, songs and similar multimedia items are the most common items which are tagged either manually or in a semiautomatic manner. However, the tagging process becomes complicated when the content structure of an item is not interpretable. Such a problems occurs in items like scientific research datasets or documents with very little text content. In this work, we propose a generalized approach to automate tag expansion for such low-content items. We leverage intelligence of the web to generate secondary content for such items for the tag expansion process. While automating tag expansion, we also address the problem of topic drift by automating removal of the noisy tags from the set of candidate new tags. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a real world dataset. The performance of the proposed is compared with Wikipedia based nearest neighbor tagging (WikiSem) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based tag expansion approaches. Based on the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric, the proposed approach was twice as accurate as the WikiSem baseline (0.27 vs 0.13) and at least 2.25 times the NMF baselines (0.27 vs 0.12).},

  abstract      = {An image in social media, termed a social image, exhibits characteristics different from images widely discussed in image processing. They can be described by both content and social related attributes, called social image attributes, including visual contents, users, tags, and timestamps. There are strong coupling relationships between social image attributes, which make social images not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). By analyzing the relationships among these attributes, we can better understand the semantic activities conducted on such non-IID social images, hence enabling new applications including content organization, recommendation, and social activity understanding. In this article, we present a novel algorithm to analyze the coupling relationships between social images, which involves not only intra-coupled similarity within a social image attribute, but also inter-coupled similarity between attributes, in analyzing the non-IIDness of the similarity between social images. In particular, we propose a multi-entry version of the coupled similarity metric to deal with attributes (i.e., tags) which have a many-to-one relationship with respect to images. Experimental results on a Flickr group dataset show that the proposed algorithm captures coupling relationships and therefore achieves promising results in various applications, including image clustering and tagging.},

Several applications, such as personalized multimedia recommendation or music genre classification, to name a few, benefit from tagging. Clearly, tagging aims at bridging the semantic gap between human concepts and content retrieval exploiting low-level features extracted from the multimedia. Here, the problem of personalized tag recommendation is addressed in a “query and ranking” manner on hypergraphs. This way, the relationships between the different object types, such as user friendships, user groups, music tracks and tags are captured and tags are recommended for a certain track to a user. Ranking on hypergraphs is studied by enforcing either ℓ2 norm regularization or group sparsity. Experiments on a dataset collected from Last.fm demonstrate a promising tag recommendation accuracy.},

We test our deep neural network by recommending hashtags for tweets with user-assigned hashtags, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the objective function.

Automatic clustering of web services groups together web services with similar functions. Clustering could greatly boost the power of web service search engines and generate tags to improve the search accuracy of tag-based service recommendation. In this paper, we propose a web service clustering technique based on Carrot search clustering and K-means to group similar services together to generate tags and we use naive bayes algorithm to classify web services. We also develop a tag-based service recommendation for WSDL documents. We demonstrate that the proposed clustering approach is effective for web service discovery.},

These sites allow developers to label posted content, referred to as software objects, with short descriptions, known as tags. However, tags assigned to objects tend to be noisy and some objects are not well tagged. To improve the quality of tags in software information sites, we propose EnTagRec, an automatic tag recommender based on historical tag assignments to software objects and we evaluate its performance on four software information sites, Stack Overflow, Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, and Free code. We observe that that EnTagRec achieves Recall@5 scores of 0.805, 0.815, 0.88 and 0.64, and Recall@10 scores of 0.868, 0.876, 0.944 and 0.753, on Stack Overflow, Ask Ubuntu, Ask Different, and Free code, respectively. In terms of Recall@5 and Recall@10, averaging across the 4 datasets, EnTagRec improves Tag Combine, which is the state of the art approach, by 27.3% and 12.9% respectively.},

  abstract        = {Semantic web service technologies have been proposed to enable automatic web service discovery and composition. But such approaches are suffered from significant effort to construct domain ontologies and to annotate web services with semantics by third parties. Hence social and collaborative tagging systems have been gaining the popularity on the web. Folksonomy-based web service annotating is emerging, i.e. to annotate web services with semantic from community-generated folksonomies. This paper focuses on how to provide folksonomy-based in-depth annotation of web services. Herein, the in-depth means the annotation is based on a structured folksonomy, and steps inside different parts of the web services in an automatic way. Two problems need addressed: exploring semantics for the folksonomy from original tags of web services, and automatically assigning tags to the different parts of web services. The paper proposes an approach to achieving automatic tags assignment of web services with a structured folksonomy. Such in-depth annotation facilitates web services discovery and composition by providing precise tagging of input, output and etc. A case-study and result of experiments on the pairs of tag-service extracted from a web service portal, seekda, illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Online sharing platforms often rely on collaborative tagging systems for annotating content. In this way, users themselves annotate and describe the shared contents using textual labels, commonly called tags. These annotations typically suffer from a number of issues such as tag scarcity or ambiguous labelling. Hence, to minimise some of these issues, tag recommendation systems can be employed to suggest potentially relevant tags during the annotation process. In this work, we present a tag recommendation system and evaluate it in the context of an online platform for audio clip sharing. By exploiting domain-specific knowledge, the system we present is able to classify an audio clip among a number of predefined audio classes and to produce specific tag recommendations for the different classes. We perform an in-depth user-based evaluation of the recommendation method along with two baselines and a former version that we described in previous work. This user-based evaluation is further complemented with a prediction-based evaluation following standard information retrieval methodologies. Results show that the proposed tag recommendation method brings a statistically significant improvement over the previous method and the baselines. In addition, we report a number of findings based on the detailed analysis of user feedback provided during the evaluation process. The considered methods, when applied to real-world collaborative tagging systems, should serve the purpose of consolidating the tagging vocabulary and improving the quality of content annotations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Searching a hash tag simply shows a list of tweets, each contains the query hash tag string. To find even more relevant hash tags, we propose to use a graph-based approach to find similar hash tags by using the social network graph around hash tags. We start by using a heterogeneous social graph that contains users, tweets, and hash tags, then we summarize the graph to a hash tag graph that shows the similarity between different hash tags. Finally, we rank the vertices in respect to a query hash tag using a random walk with restart and a content similarity measure.

  abstract      = {Event-based social networks (EBSNs), such as Meetup and Plancast, which offer platforms for users to plan, arrange, and publish events, have gained increasing popularity and rapid growth. EBSNs capture not only the online social relationship, but also the offline interactions from offline events. They contain rich heterogeneous information, including multiple types of entities, such as users, events, groups and tags, and their interaction relations. Three recommendation tasks, namely recommending groups to users, recommending tags to groups, and recommending events to users, have been explored in three separate studies. However, none of the proposed methods can handle all the three recommendation tasks. In this paper, we propose a general graph-based model, called HeteRS, to solve the three recommendation problems on EBSNs in one framework. Our method models the rich information with a heterogeneous graph and considers the recommendation problem as a query-dependent node proximity problem. To address the challenging issue of weighting the influences between different types of entities, we propose a learning scheme to set the influence weights between different types of entities. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all the three recommendation tasks, and the learned influence weights help understanding user behaviors.},

Great progress has been made especially in recent couple of years with the development of deep learning models for image content analysis and extraction of content-based concept labels. However, concept objects labels are much more friendly to machine than to users. We consider that more relevant and user-friendly visual labels need to include “context” descriptors. In this study we explore the possibilities to leverage social media content as a resource for visual labeling. We developed a tag extraction system that applies heuristic rules and term weighting method to extract image tags from associated Tweet. The system retrieves tweet-image pairs from public Twitter accounts, analyzes the Tweet, and generates labels for the images. We elaborate on different visual labeling methods, tag analysis and tag refinement methods.},

Current research has shown that applying topic modeling algorithms directly on tweets does not lead to good results. Hence one approach is to group related tweets together, so as to form a single “pseudo-document”, which is more informative than a single tweet. In this paper we evaluate different grouping schemes found in the literature and propose a new grouping scheme utilizing named entities and word collocations. Results show that our proposed scheme performs better than the existing approaches, to a some extent for all the test cases, and for both finding high-level topics and tweet labeling.},

Most studies cast image annotation into a multilabel classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity, so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.},

Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) is a traditional machine learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of basis and coefficients under the non-negative constraints. In this study, the authors propose a two-step algorithm for designing an automatic image annotation system that employs the NMF framework for its first step and a variant of K-nearest neighbourhood as its second step. In the first step, a new multimodal NMF algorithm is proposed to extract the latent factors which reflect the content of images. This is done by jointly factorising the visual and textual data feature matrices so that they have close representation, although not necessarily the same. In the second step, after mapping images to the latent factors space a few tags are predicted for the new images based on a weighted average of similar data. They evaluated the performance of the proposed method and compared it to the state-of-the-art literature. Comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method in image annotation applications.},

Using data from the StackOverflow website, the problem is to predict the tags assigned to questions. This categorization is multi-class and multi-tag, which means, a question can be assigned to different topics and can also have several tags. To solve this problem, we propose a 5-way multi-class classifier system. The results obtained by this classification scheme are discussed, by analysing certain score metrics of the classifier system. Competitive results were obtained by the 5-way classifier system, obtaining F1 scores ranging from 0.59 to 0.76. The main contribution of this paper lies on the preprocessing (which implements the feature extraction phase) and the multi-tag multi-class classification scheme.},

  abstract      = {An important aspect when sharing images in social networks is the tags the images are annotated with. Another closely related problem is the ability to successfully recommend images to users. An automatic image annotation and recommendation system is proposed based on Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2, a sketch (i.e., a coefficient vector of reduced dimensions) is obtained. To predict the tags to be assigned to a test image, the test image sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-tag matrix, yielding a tag vector. Similarly, to recommend users who might be interested to a test image, the sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-user matrix, yielding a recommendation vector. Promising results are demonstrated when the aforementioned framework is applied to an image dataset of Greek popular tourist landmarks extracted from Flickr, using a 10 fold cross-validation experimental protocol.},

The results generated by the current algorithms often ignore diversity in the recommended results, which seriously affecting the user's experience. In this paper, we address the problem of diversified coverage based tag recommendation. To our best knowledge, it is first proposed in the context of tag recommendation. Since the NP-hardness of the problem, a greedy based diversified coverage tag recommendation algorithm, namely GDC, is proposed. First, it constructs a semantic similarity graph based on the local and global tag co-occurrence matrices, which improves the recommendation accuracy by incorporating both the user's interests and the popularity of tags. Further, GDC recursively searches the MIDS (Minimum Independent Dominating Set) in an efficient manner together with an effective pruning rule. The experiments conducted on the real datasets of MovieLens and Last.fm show that the proposed GDC improve the diversity significantly.},

To solve the sparsity problem, we first introduce a new graph learning (GL) method for enriching the tagging data according to item similarities. Then, we develop a method of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) for learning more coherent ternary relations among users, images and tags coupled by the manifold constraints learned from item co-occurrences. Experimental results with the tagging data from the NUS-WIDE dataset have been reported to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Collaborative tagging data reflects the semantic perception of users, thus providing valuable information for the related recommendation problems, e.g. tag recommendation, resource recommendation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of personalized tag recommendation in social tagging services by generalizing the traditional manifold ranking idea. Specifically, we model the complex relationships in tagging data as a heterogeneous graph and propose a novel ranking algorithmic framework for heterogeneous manifolds, named GRoMO (Graph-based Ranking of Multi-type interrelated Objects). In our system both the resource to be tagged (accounting for relevance) and the user[U+05F3]s historical tags (accounting for personalization) are treated as query inputs. Then tags are ranked according to the output of GRoMO and the top tags are recommended to that user. We also explore adapting GRoMO for resource recommendation. For experiments we crawled a tagging dataset from the well-known tagging service, Del.icio.us. Experimental results indicate (1) the proposed method is effective and significantly outperforms baseline methods; (2) the iterative form solutions of GRoMO converge very fast and can be used when the dataset is large; (3) GRoMO can also be used for resource recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays, with the explosive growth of web information, the webpage classification faces great challenge. Computers have difficulty in understanding the semantic meaning of textual or non-textual webpages. Fortunately, Web 2.0 based collaborative tagging system brings new opportunities to solve this problem. It abstracts structured tags from unstructured content in webpages. However, large numbers of webpages on the Internet are less popular. Their tagging information is sparse, which makes their topic unclear and leads to ambiguous classification. Illuminated by the "ambiguous classification", we name the less popular webpage "hesitant webpage". In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for hesitant webpages classification. Firstly, hesitant webpages are divided into bridges, hubs and attached webpages according to their roles on the Internet. Secondly, attached webpages are classified by mining and extending their information in two perspectives. One is the latent semantic analysis (LSA) which is applied to fully explore the semantic meaning of sparse tags. It promotes accurate cognition of webpages semantically close to attached webpages.

  abstract      = {Mashups are prevalent Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) based applications consisting of multiple Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and content. Tags have been extensively used to organize and index mashup services. However, people favor manual tags creation in the past. This approach demands user intervention, which is extremely time-consuming and probes to errors. In this paper we propose a novel Mashup-API-Tag model for automatic mashup tag recommendation. The model simultaneously incorporates the composition relationships between mashups and APIs as well as the annotation relationships between APIs and tags to discover the latent topics. Then the semantic similarity between Web APIs and mashups can be acquired. Subsequently, tags of chosen APIs are recommended to a mashup where the mashup and the APIs are most similar. In addition, we develop a tag filtering algorithm to select the most relevant tags for recommendation. The experimental results on a real world dataset prove that our approach outperforms other methods, including frequency-based methods and the methods that only consider the composition relationships and the annotation relationships separately.},

  abstract      = {Social media platforms such as Flickr allow users to annotate photos with descriptive keywords, called, tags with the goal of making multimedia content easily understandable, searchable, and discoverable. However, manual annotation is very time-consuming and cumbersome for most users, which makes it difficult to search relevant photos. Moreover, predicted tags for a photo are not necessarily relevant to users' interests. Thus, it necessitates for an automatic tag prediction system that considers users' interests and describes objective aspects of the photo such as visual content and activities. To this end, this paper presents a tag recommendation system, called, PROMPT, that recommends personalized tags for a given photo leveraging personal and social contexts. Specifically, first, we determine a group of users who have similar tagging behavior as the user of the photo, which is very useful in recommending personalized tags. Next, we find candidate tags from visual content, textual metadata, and tags of neighboring photos, and recommends five most suitable tags. We initialize scores of the candidate tags using asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities and normalized scores of tags after neighbor voting, and later perform random walk to promote the tags that have many close neighbors and weaken isolated tags. Finally, we recommend top five user tags to the given photo. Experimental results on a Flickr dataset (46,700 photos in the test set and 28 million photos in the train set) with 1,540 unique user tags confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

The advantage of our tag-based subclasses is that they have a chance of being more visually stable and easier to model than top-level classes. Our contribution is to demonstrate that a simple and inexpensive method for generating sub-class representations has the ability to improve classification results in the case of tag classes that are visually highly heterogenous.

Being aware of this drawback, we develop a novel graph regularized low-rank feature mapping for image annotation under semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, our approach refers to the idea of matrix recovery and uses the matrix trace norm to capture the correlations among different tags. It also helps to control the model complexity. In addition, by using graph Laplacian regularization as a smooth operator, the proposed approach can explicitly take into account the local geometric structure on both labeled and unlabeled images. Moreover, considering the tags of labeled images tend to be missing or noisy, we introduce a supplementary ideal label matrix to solve the problems of missing tags and noisy tags for given training samples.

We apply our approach to the tags obtained from Android-related Stack Overflow posts and evaluate the resulting tag communities quantitatively with various community metrics. In addition, we evaluate our approach qualitatively through a manual inspection and comparison of a random sample of tag communities.

Inspired by the assumption that people order their tags, we propose a new way of measuring tag preferences, and also propose a new personalized tagging objective function that explicitly considers a user's preferred tag orderings. We also provide a (partially) greedy algorithm that produces good solutions to our new objective and under certain conditions produces an optimal solution.

Since large amounts of documents and code in GitHub repositories are in a mess, users cannot search or understand them efficiently. One solution is to employ a tag system, which annotates each repository with several tags. Thus, the GitHub repositories can be more efficiently accessed and understood. However, GitHub does not provide any automated tools of tagging repositories. In order to tackle this problem, we propose GRETA, a novel graph-based approach to assigning tags for repositories on GitHub. The core insight of GRETA is (1) to construct an Entity-Tag Graph (ETG) for GitHub using the domain knowledge from StackOverflow, and (2) to assign tags for repositories by taking a random walk algorithm. We have implemented GRETA and also developed a repository search engine for GitHub using the tag assignment results of GRETA. We have evaluated GRETA against several baseline methods to investigate its effectiveness of tagging GitHub repositories. The results show GRETA achieves up to 35% of F-Measure, outperforming the baseline methods. Besides, the GRETA-based search engine gains a higher NDCG value than the search engine provided by GitHub, indicating that it significantly enhances the search ability on GitHub with the tagged repositories.},

In a folksonomy system, the tags are added by learners to the learning resources, hence the tags are often ambiguous, overly personalised and imprecise. In addition, conjugated words, compound words and nonsense words may be used in tagging and shared among a group of learners. This has resulted in an uncontrolled and chaotic set of tagging terms that cause learning resources searching, reuse and sharing to become ineffective. In this paper, we present a content-based approach which automatically generates tags from a learning resource using Part-Of-Speech Tagging and K-Means Clustering techniques. The generated tags are more precise and unambiguous which can improve learning resources searching, reuse and sharing among learners. © 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

  abstract      = {Social tags serve as a textual source of simple but useful semantic metadata that reflect user preferences or describe web objects and have been widely used in many applications. However, social tags have several unique characteristics, i.e., sparseness and data coupling (i.e. non-IIDness), which means that existing text analysis methods such as LDA are not directly applicable. In this article, we propose a new generative algorithm for social tag analysis named Joint Latent Dirichlet Allocation that models tag generation based on both users and objects and, thus, accounts for the coupling relationships among social tags. The model introduces two latent factors that jointly influence tag generation: the user's latent interest factor and the object's latent topic factor, formulated as a user-topic distribution matrix and an object-topic distribution matrix, respectively. A Gibbs sampling approach is adopted to simultaneously infer the above two matrices as well as a topic-word distribution matrix. Experimental results on four social tagging datasets showed that our model is able to capture more reasonable topics and achieves better performance than five state-of-the-art topic models in terms of the widely-used point-wise mutual information (PMI) metric. In addition, we analyze the learned topics and show that our model recovers more themes from social tags, while LDA may lead to vanishing topic problems. We also demonstrate our model's advantages in social recommendation by evaluating the retrieval results using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric. Finally, we explore the joint procedure of our model in depth to show the non-IID characteristics of the social tagging process.},

  abstract      = {In the social image sharing websites (such as Flickr), users are allowed to upload images and to tag them with tags. Due to the diversities of users’ interests, different users may tag the same image with different tags. Therefore, tags not only reveal some important image semantic clues, but also show user’s preference, which can provide a new effective solution for overcoming the semantic gap as well as realizing a personalized recommendation. In this paper, a personalized social image recommendation method based on User-Image-Tag model is proposed. The main contributions of our work are that: (1) to efficiently make use of tags, social image tags are re-ranked according to the image content; (2) to obtain user preference, a User-Image-Tag model is constructed with tripartite graph according to the correlation among users, images and Topranking tags; (3) a personalized social recommendation system is implemented based on User-Image-Tag model. Experimental results proved our method can significantly improve the accuracy of personalized image recommendation.},

In this paper, we focus on the problem of social image understanding, i.e., tag refinement, tag assignment, and image retrieval. Different from previous work, we propose a novel weakly supervised deep matrix factorization algorithm, which uncovers the latent image representations and tag representations embedded in the latent subspace by collaboratively exploring the weakly supervised tagging information, the visual structure, and the semantic structure. Due to the well-known semantic gap, the hidden representations of images are learned by a hierarchical model, which are progressively transformed from the visual feature space. It can naturally embed new images into the subspace using the learned deep architecture. The semantic and visual structures are jointly incorporated to learn a semantic subspace without overfitting the noisy, incomplete, or subjective tags. Besides, to remove the noisy or redundant visual features, a sparse model is imposed on the transformation matrix of the first layer in the deep architecture. Finally, a unified optimization problem with a well-defined objective function is developed to formulate the proposed problem and solved by a gradient descent procedure with curvilinear search. Extensive experiments on real-world social image databases are conducted on the tasks of image understanding: image tag refinement, assignment, and retrieval. Encouraging results are achieved with comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract      = {Software developers can search, share and learn development experience, solutions, bug fixes and open source projects in software information sites such as StackOverflow and Freecode. Many software information sites rely on tags to classify their contents, i.e. software objects, in order to improve the performance and accuracy of various operations on the sites. The quality of tags thus has a significant impact on the usefulness of these sites. High quality tags are expected to be concise and can describe the most important features of the software objects. Unfortunately tagging is inherently an uncoordinated process. The choice of tags made by individual software developers is dependent not only on a developer's understanding of the software object but also on the developer's English skills and preferences. As a result, the number of different tags grows rapidly along with continuous addition of software objects. With thousands of different tags, many of which introduce noise, software objects become poorly classified. Such phenomenon affects negatively the speed and accuracy of developers' queries. In this paper, we propose a tool called TagMulRec to automatically recommend tags and classify software objects in evolving large-scale software information sites. Given a new software object, TagMulRec locates the software objects that are semantically similar to the new one and exploit their tags. We have evaluated TagMulRec on four software information sites, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, AskDifferent and Freecode. According to our empirical study, TagMulRec is not only accurate but also scalable that can handle a large-scale software information site with millions of software objects and thousands of tags.},

However, traditional classification-based representation learning methods face the noisy and incomplete problem of the supervisory labels. In this paper, we propose a General Knowledge Base Embedded Image Representation Learning approach, which uses general knowledge graph, which is a multi-type relational knowledge graph consisting of human commonsense beyond image space, as external semantic resource to capture the relations of concepts in image representation learning. A Relational Regularized Regression CNN (R$^{3}$CNN) model is designed to jointly optimize the image representation learning problem and knowledge graph embedding problem. In this manner, the learnt representation can capture not only labeled tags but also related concepts of images, which involves more precise and complete semantics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and transferability of our approach in tag prediction task, zero-shot tag inference task, and content based image retrieval task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the existing representation learning methods. Finally, observation of the learnt relations show that our approach can somehow refine the knowledge base to describe images and label the images with structured tags.},

On the social media, images usually have an incomplete or noisy set of social tags provided by the mobile users, and we consider this issue as defective tag assignments. Previous studies on social image tagging have mostly focused on multi-label classification without considering the defective tags. In these studies, the usage of multi-label classification techniques is expected to synergically exploit the linear relations between the image features and the semantic tags. However, these approaches usually aimed to capture the linear relations from the training data while ignoring the helpful information from the test data. In addition, they failed to incorporate the non-linear associations residing in the visual features as well as in the semantic tags. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a novel approach based on non-linear matrix completion for image tagging task with defective tags. Specifically, we first construct the entire feature-tag matrix based on the visual features with non-linear kernel mapping. Then, we present a formal methodology together with an optimization method under the matrix completion framework to jointly complete the tags of training and test images. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method shows promising results on image tagging task on two benchmark social image datasets with defective tags, and establishes a baseline for such models in this research domain.},

To handle these problems, we use a co-regularization approach to learn a pair of classifiers on sound and text. The first classifier maps low-level audio features to a true tag list. The second classifier maps actively corrupted tags to the true tags, reducing incorrect mappings caused by low-level acoustic variations in the first classifier, and to augment the tags with additional relevant tags. Training the classifiers is implemented using marginal co-regularization, pair of which draws the two classifiers into agreement by a joint optimization. We evaluate this approach on two sound datasets, Freefield1010 and Task4 of DCASE2016. The results obtained show that marginal co-regularization outperforms the baseline GMM in both efficiency and effectiveness.},

  abstract      = {Due to the unprecedented growth of unedited videos, finding highlights relevant to a text query in a set of unedited videos has become increasingly important. We refer this task as semantic highlight retrieval and propose a query-dependent video representation for retrieving a variety of highlights. Our method consists of two parts: 1) “viralets”, a mid-level representation bridging between semantic [Fig. 1(a)] and visual [Fig. 1(c)] spaces and 2) a novel Semantic-MODulation (SMOD) procedure to make viralets query-dependent (referred to as SMOD viralets). Given SMOD viralets, we train a single highlight ranker to predict the highlightness of clips with respect to a variety of queries (two examples in Fig. 1), whereas existing approaches can be applied only in a few predefined domains. Other than semantic highlight retrieval, viralets can also be used to associate relevant terms to each video. We utilize this property and propose a simple term prediction method based on nearest neighbor search. To conduct experiments, we collect a viral video dataset1 including users’ comments, highlights, and/or original videos. Among a testing database with 1189 clips (13% highlights and 87% non-highlights), our highlight ranker achieves 41.2% recall at top-10 retrieved clips. It is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art domain-specific highlight ranker and its extension. Similarly, our method also outperforms all baseline methods on the publicly available video highlight dataset. Finally, our simple term prediction method utilizing viralets outperforms the state-of-the-art matrix factorization method (adapted from Kalayeh et al.). 1

Viral videos refer to popular online videos. We focus on user-generated viral videos, which typically contain short highlight marked by users.

This paper proposes a novel framework that introduces noise correction techniques to further improve the quality of integrated labels that are inferred from the multiple noisy labels of objects. In the proposed general framework, information about the qualities of labelers estimated by a front-end ground truth inference algorithm is utilized to supervise subsequent label noise filtering and correction. The framework uses a novel algorithm termed adaptive voting noise correction (AVNC) to precisely identify and correct the potential noisy labels. After filtering out the instances with noisy labels, the remaining cleansed data set is used to create multiple weak classifiers, based on which a powerful ensemble classifier is induced to correct these noises. Experimental results on eight simulated data sets with different kinds of features and two real-world crowdsourcing data sets in different domains consistently show that: 1) the proposed framework can improve label quality regardless of inference algorithms, especially under the circumstance that each instance has a few repeated labels and 2) since the proposed AVNC algorithm considers both the number of and the probability of potential label noises, it outperforms the state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms.},

Despite the captivating opportunities offered by these techniques, collecting annotations for a large heritage collection is no trivial task. A significant amount of work is required to manually annotate large quantities of heritage materials, and automated, computational approaches leave much to be desired regarding the level of insight and semantic richness that they can currently provide. By analysing the emergent relationships between the initial annotations in a collection, we propose a metadata-driven algorithm for assisting and augmenting the annotation process. This algorithm, called SAGA (Semantically-Annotated Graph Analysis), allows for semi-automatic annotation, which balances the value of the contributions of human annotators with the time and effort-saving benefits of an automatic, suggestion-driven process. SAGA uses an entity relationship-driven approach to make annotation suggestions. It is used in the context of a web-based infrastructure called SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration), a multiagent environment which assists groups of experts in creating comprehensive annotation sets for heritage collections. SAGA and SAGE are evaluated from the perspectives of suggestion accuracy, explicit user acceptance and implicit user acceptance, and demonstrate strong results in each evaluation. © 2017 ACM.},

In this sense, similarity is used to propose labels (tags) to yet unlabeled songs, based on the content-based distance between them. The main goal of our work is to ease the process of annotating huge music collections, by using content-based similarity distances as a way to propagate labels among songs. <br />
<br />
We present two different experiments. The first one propagates labels that are related with the style of the piece, whereas the second experiment deals with mood labels. On the one hand, our approach shows that using a music collection annotated at 40\% with styles, and using content-based, the collection can be automatically annotated up to 78\% (that is, 40\% already annotated and the rest, 38\%, only using propagation), with a recall greater than 0.4. On the other hand, for a smaller music collection annotated at 30\% with moods, the collection can be automatically annotated up to 65\% (e.g. 30\% plus 35\% using propagation).

  abstract      = { Abstract Social tags are user-generated keywords associated with some resource on the Web. In the case of music, social tags have become an important component of “Web 2.0” recommender systems, allowing users to generate playlists based on use-dependent terms such as chill or jogging that have been applied to particular songs. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting these social tags directly from MP3 files. Using a set of 360 classifiers trained using the online ensemble learning algorithm FilterBoost, we map audio features onto social tags collected from the Web. The resulting automatic tags (or autotags) furnish information about music that is otherwise untagged or poorly tagged, allowing for insertion of previously unheard music into a social recommender. This avoids the “cold-start problem” common in such systems. Autotags can also be used to smooth the tag space from which similarities and recommendations are made by providing a set of comparable baseline tags for all tracks in a recommender system. Because the words we learn are the same as those used by people who label their music collections, it is easy to integrate our predictions into existing similarity and prediction methods based on web data. },

Tag recommendation represents a trade-off between automatic image annotation techniques and manual tagging. In this letter, we formulate image tag recommendation as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, making use of a visual folksonomy. A folksonomy can be seen as a collaboratively created set of metadata for informal social classification. Our experimental results show that the use of a visual folksonomy for image tag recommendation has two significant benefits, compared to a conventional approach using a limited concept vocabulary. First, our tag recommendation technique can make use of an unrestricted and rich concept vocabulary. Second, our approach is able to recommend a higher number of correct tags.},

But in cold-start situations i.e., when new users or resources enter the system, state-of-the-art tag recommender systems perform poorly and are not always able to generate recommendations. Many user profiles contain untagged resources, which could provide valuable information especially for cold-start scenarios where tagged data is scarce. The existing methods do not explore this additional information source. In this paper we propose to use a purely graph-based semi-supervised relational approach that uses untagged posts for addressing the cold-start problem. We conduct experiments on two real-life datasets and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in many cases.},

We propose a method to suggest tags according to the text description of a resource. By considering both the description and tags of a given resource as summaries to the resource written in two languages, we adopt word alignment models in statistical machine translation to bridge their vocabulary gap. Based on the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and the tags estimated on a large set of description-tags pairs, we build a word trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags according to the words in a resource description. Experiments on real world datasets show that WTM is effective and robust compared with other methods. Moreover, WTM is relatively simple and efficient, which is practical for Web applications.},

  abstract      = {The emergence of Web 2.0 and the consequent success of social network Web sites such as Del.icio.us and Flickr introduce us to a new concept called social bookmarking, or tagging. Tagging is the action of connecting a relevant user-defined keyword to a document, image, or video, which helps the user to better organize and share their collections of interesting stuff. With the rapid growth of Web 2.0, tagged data is becoming more and more abundant on the social network Web sites. An interesting problem is how to automate the process of making tag recommendations to users when a new resource becomes available.

In this article, we address the issue of tag recommendation from a machine learning perspective. From our empirical observation of two large-scale datasets, we first argue that the user-centered approach for tag recommendation is not very effective in practice. Consequently, we propose two novel document-centered approaches that are capable of making effective and efficient tag recommendations in real scenarios. The first, graph-based, method represents the tagged data in two bipartite graphs, (document, tag) and (document, word), then finds document topics by leveraging graph partitioning algorithms. The second, prototype-based, method aims at finding the most representative documents within the data collections and advocates a sparse multiclass Gaussian process classifier for efficient document classification. For both methods, tags are ranked within each topic cluster/class by a novel ranking method. Recommendations are performed by first classifying a new document into one or more topic clusters/classes, and then selecting the most relevant tags from those clusters/classes as machine-recommended tags.

Experiments on real-world data from Del.icio.us, CiteULike, and BibSonomy examine the quality of tag recommendation as well as the efficiency of our recommendation algorithms. The results suggest that our document-centered models can substantially improve the performance of tag recommendations when compared to the user-centered methods, as well as topic models LDA and SVM classifiers.

To organize this information and make it accessible via current search technology, tagging systems have gained tremendous popularity. Especially for multimedia content they allow to annotate resources with keywords (tags) which opens the door for classic text-based information retrieval. To support the user in choosing the right keywords, tag recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this setting, not only the content is decisive for recommending relevant tags but also the user's preferences. In this paper we introduce an approach to personalized tag recommendation that combines a probabilistic model of tags from the resource with tags from the user. As models we investigate simple language models as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extensive experiments on a real world dataset crawled from a big tagging system show that personalization improves tag recommendation, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

Latent relationships and patterns can be discovered by applying tensor factorization techniques like Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), Canonical Decomposition etc. STS accumulate large amount of sparse data that restricts factorization techniques to detect latent relations and also significantly slows down the process of a factorization. We propose to reduce tag space by exploiting clustering techniques so that the quality of the recommendations and execution time are improved and memory requirements are decreased. The clustering is motivated by the fact that many tags in a tag space are semantically similar thus the tags can be grouped. Finally, promising experimental results are presented.},

In this paper, we study personalized tag recommendation in a popular online photo sharing site --- Flickr. Social relationship information of users is collected to generate an online social network. From the perspective of network topology, we propose node topological potential to characterize user's social influence. With this metric, we distinguish different social relations between users and find out those who really have influence on the target users. Tag recommendations are based on tagging history and the latent personalized preference learned from those who have most influence in user's social network. We evaluate our method on large scale real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can outperform the non-personalized global co-occurrence method and other two state-of-the-art personalized approaches using social networks. We also analyze the further usage of our approach for the cold-start problem of tag recommendation.},

  abstract      = {Social bookmarking system is a web-based resource sharing system that allows users to upload, share and organize  their  resources  i.e.  bookmarks  and  publications.  The  system  has  shifted  the  paradigm  of bookmarking  from  an  individual  activity  limited  to 
desktop  to  a  collective  activity  on  the  web.  It  also facilitates  user  to  annotate  his  resource  with  free  form  tags  that  leads  to  large  communities  of  users to collaboratively  create  accessible  repositories  of  web  resources.  Tagging  process  has  its  own  challenges like  ambiguity,  redundancy  or  misspelled  tags  and  sometimes  user  tends  to  avoid  it  as  he  has  to  describe tag  at  his  own.  The  resultant  tag  space  is  noisy  or  very  sparse  and  dilutes  the  purpose  of  tagging.  The effective  solution  is  Tag  Recommendation  System  that  automatically  suggests  appropriate  set  of  tags  touser  while  annotating  resource.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  framework  that  does  not  depend  on  tagging history  of  the  resource  or  user  and  thereby  capable  of  suggesting  tags  to  the  resources  which  are  being submitted  to  the  system  first  time.  We  model  tag  recommendation  task  as  multi-label  text  classification problem and use Naive Bayes classifier as the base learner of the multilabel classifier. We experiment with Boolean,  bag-of-words  and  term  frequency-inverse  document  frequency  (TFIDF)  representation  of  the resources  and  fit  appropriate  distribution  to  the  data  based  on  the  representation  used.  Impact  of  feature selection  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  tag  recommendation  is  also  studied. Effectiveness  of  the  proposed framework is evaluated through precision, recall and f-measure metrics.  },

Existing tag recommendation methods can be divided into collaborative filtering methods and content based methods. In this paper, we put our focus on the content based tag recommendation due to its wider applicability. Our key observation is the tag-content co-occurrence, i.e., many tags have appeared multiple times in the corresponding content. Based on this observation, we propose a generative model (Tag2Word), where we generate the words based on the tag-word distribution as well as the tag itself. Experimental evaluations on real data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, while enjoying linear scalability.},

Social tags are the keywords annotated by users to the images, which contains the information for searching and classifying the images. Tag recommendation system allows mitigating the individual preferences to annotate and recommender images. However, irrelevant and noise tags are frequently included in tags. In this paper, we propose image tag recommendation based on the friends' relationships in social network (TRboFS) to recommender tags for a new image, both the tags assigned to the favorite images and the friendships of the users who upload the image are employed to predict the tags of the images. Empirical analyses on real datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance to existing approaches.},

Such systems typically provide simple tag recommendations to increase the number of tags assigned to resources. In this paper we extend the latent Dirichlet allocation topic model to include user data and use the estimated probability distributions in order to provide personalised tag suggestions to users. We describe the resulting tripartite topic model in detail and show how it can be utilised to make personalised tag suggestions. Then, using data from a large-scale, real life tagging system, test our system against several baseline methods. Our experiments show a statistically significant increase in performance of our model over all key metrics, indicating that the model could be successfully used to provide further social tagging tools such as resource suggestion and collaborative filtering.},

Along the ECML PKDD 2009 Discovery Challenge, we design a tag recommender that accurately predicts the tagging behavior of users within the Bibsonomy bookmarking service. We find that the tagging vocabularies among folksonomy users differ radically due to multilingual aspects as well as heterogeneous tagging habits. Our model overcomes the prediction problem resulting from these heterogeneities by translating user vocabularies, so called personomies, to the global folksonomy vocabulary and vice versa. Furthermore we combine our user-centric translation approach with item-centric methods to achieve more accurate solutions. Since our method is purely graph-based, it can also readily be applied to other folksonomies.},

User tags provide much useful information for user retrieval and precision advertising. However, 64.2% of users in our study have not tagged themselves. This paper aims to providemicroblogger tag auto-annotation. First, we analyze the tagging behaviors of users to explore what information that is contained in the tagging. Second, based on the analyses and features of social networking, we propose two methods of user tag auto-annotation: one is Collective Filtering (CF) based method and the other is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) based method. Specifically, the CF-based method annotates tags for one user according to the voting scheme by considering his/her neighboring users' tags. By contrast, the PLSA-based method annotates tags for one user according to the topic distribution of his/her neighboring users' tags. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the CF-based method outperforms the PLSA-based method at word-level; and (2) the PLSA-based method can obtain more accurate tag annotation results than the CF-based method at topic-level.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a successful solution for annotating contributed resources to online sharing platforms, facilitating searching, browsing, and organizing their contents. To aid users in the annotation process, several tag recommendation methods have been proposed. It has been repeatedly hypothesized that these methods should contribute to improving annotation quality and reducing the cost of the annotation process. It has been also hypothesized that these methods should contribute to the consolidation of the vocabulary of collaborative tagging systems. However, to date, no empirical and quantitative result supports these hypotheses. In this work, we deeply analyze the impact of a tag recommendation system in the folksonomy of Freesound, a real-world and large-scale online sound sharing platform. Our results suggest that tag recommendation effectively increases vocabulary sharing among users of the platform. In addition, tag recommendation is shown to contribute to the convergence of the vocabulary as well as to a partial increase in the quality of annotations. However, according to our analysis, the cost of the annotation process does not seem to be effectively reduced. Our work is relevant to increase our understanding about the nature of tag recommendation systems and points to future directions for the further development of those systems and their analysis. © 2015 ACM.},

  abstract = {As cross-lingual information retrieval is attracting increasing attention, tools that measure cross-lingual semantic similarity between documents are becoming desirable. In this paper, two aspects of cross-lingual semantic document similarity measures are investigated: One is document representation, and the other is the formulation of similarity measures. Fuzzy set and rough set theories are applied to capture the inherently fuzzy relationships among concepts expressed by natural languages. Our approach first develops a language-independent sense-level document representation based on the fuzzy set model to reduce the barrier between different languages and further explores the fuzzy-rough hybrid approach to obtain a more robust macrosense-level document representation through the partitioning of the integrated sense association network of the document collection into macrosenses. Then, Tversky's notion of similarity and the F1 measure on information retrieval are adopted to formulate, respectively, two document similarity measures with fuzzy set operations on the two proposed document representations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by its success rate in identifying the English translations to their corresponding Chinese documents in a collection of Chinese-English parallel documents. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to process documents in other languages. It is believed that the proposed representations, along with the similarity measures, will enable more effective text mining processes.},

The tags generated from collaborative tagging provide highly abstracted information about users' personal taste on information item, and therefore could be used to profile both users and items. However, flattening the three dimensional user-tag-item matrix into two-way matrices will lead to loss of two dimensional relationships between users, items and tags completely. In this paper, we use a predictive bilinear model to capture the informative interaction patterns among user-tag and item-tag matrices, and employ the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to extract lower dimensional representative features from tags. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach substantially outperforms the traditional CF methods as well as tag-based recommendation methods reported in the literature. © 2010 IEEE.},

This study investigated the effects that the major context of use (work vs. non-work) has had on experiences with the social book marking service. A within-subject experiment was conducted with 77 subjects. Each took part in both work and non-work information tasks by interacting with six navigation aids. The MANOVA analysis results showed that the contexts of use, work versus non-work, have a significant effect on user information interaction experiences. Moreover, user expertise for work-related tasks has a significant impact on the user perceptions of navigation aids as helpful way finding cues. Understanding how users interact with various way finding cues can enlighten design considerations for refining social navigation functions.

The next relies on look-up functions across multiple databases to determine the probable semantic layer of each tag. Examples of the semantic layers with prevalence rates are given based on application of the scheme to a subset of the Million Song Dataset. Finally, a validation of the results was carried out with an independent, smaller hand-annotated dataset, in which high agreement between the identification provided by the scheme and annotations was found.},

Researchers have proposed several models to predict this distribution, but these models depend on specific system. What's more, data fitting methods were failed to describe the raw data precisely compared with a mathematical model. Random Group Formation (RGF) model is a newly proposed mathematical model which could predict the power law distribution precisely. This model does not depend on the specific system. It could predict the power law distribution precisely using only three values: total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. In this paper, RGF model is employed to predict the power law distribution of tag frequency. The experiments show that the power law distribution of tag frequency can be predicted precisely by three values, and the distribution is independent on specific system. The analysis of the tag dataset using RGF model shows that the exponent of power law decreases with the increasing of the dataset's size.},

Social tags are the keywords annotated by users to the multimedia objects. These tags contain the information which allows multimedia objects to be located and classified. Unfortunately, irrelevant information and noise are frequently included in such tags, especially when we use social tagging systems. Imperfect as they may be, social tags are still a significant source of human-generated contextual knowledge. We present the Waking And Sleeping (WAS) algorithm to overcome the obstacle of noisy tags. WAS refines social tags of each image and assigns each tag into either the waking state or the sleeping state. With WAS, the recommendation system not only enhances the accuracy of the recommendation results based on tags with higher quality but also reduces the consumption of computational resources. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to compared methods.},

Many millions of citizens around the world own smartphones, which they use for both personal and business applications. The majority of smartphones are designed towards Location-based Services (LBS). Consequently these smartphones have on-board GPS devices with the ability of locating the user to an accuracy of a few meters. While at the begining of the growth in popularity of smartphones and LBS technologies most users simply consumed services: where is the nearest coffee shop or subway station? Today, citizens are generating spatial data and information at ever increasing volumes. Examples include: georeferenced photographic collections, location-based social networking such as FourSquare, and volunteered geographic information (VGI). VGI is an exciting movement whereby citizens collect spatial data and information about (their own or another) locality. This content is then shared in collaborative projects such as OpenStreetMap, Geonames, Google Maps Mashups, or WikiMapia. This paper explores the risks involved in using this user-generated spatial data and information with specific emphasis on OpenStreetMap. Most citizens are not specialists in geographic surveying or cartography. Our paper provides results of a large case-study of high edit geographical features. We show that user generated spatial data is a very dynamic but has many inconsistencies.},

  abstract = {Large-scale user contributed images with tags are easily available on photo sharing websites. However, the noisy or incomplete correspondence between the images and tags prohibits them from being leveraged for precise image retrieval and effective management. To tackle the problem of tag refinement, we propose a method of Ranking based Multi-correlation Tensor Factorization (RMTF), to jointly model the ternary relations among user, image, and tag, and further to precisely reconstruct the user-aware image-tag associations as a result. Since the user interest or background can be explored to eliminate the ambiguity of image tags, the proposed RMTF is believed to be superior to the traditional solutions, which only focus on the binary image-tag relations. During the model estimation, we employ a ranking based optimization scheme to interpret the tagging data, in which the pair-wise qualitative difference between positive and negative examples is used, instead of the point-wise 0/1 confidence. Specifically, the positive examples are directly decided by the observed user-image-tag interrelations, while the negative ones are collected with respect to the most semantically and contextually irrelevant tags. Extensive experiments on a benchmark Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for tag refinement. We also show attractive performances on two potential applications as the by-products of the ternary relation analysis.},

The meaning of a tag as well as the precise relation between a tag and the tagged resource are left open for interpretation to the user. Although human users mostly have a fair chance at interpreting this relation, machines do not. In this paper we study the characteristics of the problem to identify descriptive tags, i.e. tags that relate to visible objects in a picture. We investigate the feasibility of using a tag-based algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that ignores actual picture content, to tackle the problem. Given the theoretical feasibility of a well-performing tag-based algorithm, which we show via an optimal algorithm, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a WordNet-based algorithm as proof-of-concept. These two investigations lead to the conclusion that even relatively simple and fast tag-based algorithms can yet predict human ratings of which objects a picture shows. Finally, we discuss the inherent difficulty both humans and machines have when deciding whether a tag is descriptive or not. Based on a qualitative analysis, we distinguish between definitional disagreement, difference in knowledge, disambiguation and difference in perception as reasons for disagreement between raters. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

We present the results from two empirical studies over 36 and 12 months, respectively, on how tagging has been adopted and what role it plays in the development processes of several professional development projects with more than 1,000 developers in total. Our research shows that the tagging mechanism was eagerly adopted by the teams, and that it has become a significant part of many informal processes. Different kinds of tags are used by various stakeholders to categorize and organize work items. The tags are used to support finding of tasks, articulation work, and information exchange. Implicit and explicit mechanisms have evolved to manage the tag vocabulary. Our findings indicate that lightweight informal tool support, prevalent in the social computing domain, may play an important role in improving team-based software development practices.},

  abstract  = {The enormous success and diffusion that online social networks (OSNs) are encountering nowadays is vastly apparent. Users' social interactions now occur using online social media as communication channels; personal information and activities are easily exchanged both for recreational and business purposes in order to obtain social or economic advantages. In this scenario, OSNs are considered critical applications with respect to the security of users and their resources, for their characteristics alone: the large amount of personal information they manage, big economic upturn connected to their commercial use, strict interconnection among users and resources characterizing them, as well as user attitude to easily share private data and activities with strangers. In this book, we discuss three main research topics connected to security in online social networks: (i) trust management, because trust can be intended as a measure of the perception of security (in terms of risks/benefits) hat users in an OSN have with respect to other (unknown/little-known) parties; (ii) controlled information sharing, because in OSNs, where personal information is not only connected to user profiles, but spans across users' social activities and interactions, users must be provided with the possibility to directly control information flows; and (iii) identity management, because OSNs are subjected more and more to malicious attacks that, with respect to traditional ones, have the advantage of being more effective by leveraging the social network as a new medium for reaching victims. For each of these research topics, in this book we provide both theoretical concepts as well as an overview of the main solutions that commercial/non-commercial actors have proposed over the years. We also discuss some of the most promising research directions in these fields.},

  abstract  = {Tagging recommender systems allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The connection among users, resources and these annotations, often called afolksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, and to obtain recommendations. Releasing these tagging datasets accelerates both commercial and research work on recommender systems. However, adversaries may re-identify a user and her/his sensitivity information from the tagging dataset using a little background information. Recently, several private techniques have been proposed to address the problem, but most of them lack a strict privacy notion, and can hardly resist the number of possible attacks. This paper proposes an private releasing algorithm to perturb users' profile in a strict privacy notion, differential privacy, with the goal of preserving a user's identity in a tagging dataset. The algorithm includes three privacy preserving operations: Private Tag Clustering is used to shrink the randomized domain and Private Tag Selection is then applied to find the most suitable replacement tags for the original tags. To hide the numbers of tags, the third operation, Weight Perturbation, finally adds Lap lace noise to the weight of tags We present extensive experimental results on two real world datasets, Delicious and Bibsonomy. While the personalization algorithmis successful in both cases.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel Tensor Factorization and tag Clustering (TFC) model is presented for item recommendation in social tagging systems. The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and “cold start” problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative tf ·idf weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD.},

User profiling techniques have performed the core role in this research. Traditionally, most user profiling techniques create user representations in a static way. However, changes of user interests may occur with time in real world applications. In this research we develop algorithms for mining user interests by integrating time decay mechanisms into topic-based user interest profiling. Time forgetting functions will be integrated into the calculation of topic interest measurements on in-depth level. The experimental study shows that, considering temporal effects of user interests by integrating time forgetting mechanisms shows better performance of recommendation.},

Most of the available modules in recommender systems, don't consider information such as time that could be effective on the users preferences of a resource. So, one of the existing challenges in resource recommendation systems is the appropriate integration of tag and time information to discover user's taste considering time drift and improving accuracy. In this paper data from social tagging systems are modeled with four-mode tensors to capture four-way correlations between users, items, tags and time information. Then by applying multi-way analysis, latent correlations among users preferences based on time information are revealed, which help to improve the quality of recommendations. The advantages of proposed system are that it considers simultaneous relations among elements, discovers latent associations and improves the quality of recommendations accuracy. The experimental results on a real-world dataset, Citeulike, indicate significant improvements in recommendation quality and better performance compared with the existing systems.},

The technology does not rely on actual content of the items, but instead requires users to indicate preferences, most commonly in the form of ratings. While CF is known for its traditional problems such as cold-start, sparsity and modest accuracy, a trust-based CF has been previously proposed to solve such issues by focusing on trust values among the users. Nonetheless, all existing trust-based approaches use trust as a factor independent from scope, whether explicit or implicit. We argue that trustworthiness should not be the same across all conditions; hence the trust values should change to suit certain scope or focused area. To validate the proposed temporal-focused trustworthiness in this paper, we propose a novel pheromone-based approach to calculate trustworthiness by focusing on time factor. Implementation of the proposed approach is hoped to reduce cold-start and sparsity as well as improve accuracy of the recommendation results.},

We have developed a MATLAB toolbox called CTAGGER to enable a user-friendly, semi-structured and expandable strategy for event annotation in dynamic brain imaging and other time-series. To facilitate common labeling and comparison across data collections and laboratories, an individual's annotation can be collected in a common community database to encourage annotation reuse.

A novel concept based on collaborative tagging is presented, which is designed to bridge this gap. This concept, named Rated Tags, uses a hybrid approach to combine tagging-, rating- and review functionality. A key element of Rated Tags is the combination of a traditional user generated tag and a 5-star rating scale. Such a tag is called rated tag. We will discuss the design and the challenges of Rated Tags in detail and demonstrate its application based on a prototype. Furthermore we will show that similar related works suffer from an ambiguity problem, which was avoided in Rated Tags. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, enable a user to annotate various web resources with a free set of tags for sharing and searching purposes. Tags in a folksonomy reflect users' collaborative cognition about information. Tags play an important role in a folksonomy as a means of indexing information to facilitate search and navigation of resources. However, the semantics of the tags, and therefore the semantics of the resources, are neither known nor explicitly stated. It is therefore difficult for users to find related resources due to the absence of a consistent semantic meaning among tags. The shortage of relevant tags increases data sparseness and decreases the rate of information extraction with respect to user queries. Defining semantic relationships between tags, resources, and users is an important research issue for the retrieval of related information from folksonomies. In this research, a method for finding semantic relationships among tags is proposed. The present study considers not only the pairwise relationships between tags, resources, and users, but also the relationships among all three. Experimental results using real datasets from Flickr and Del.icio.us show that the method proposed here is more effective than previous methods such as LCH, JCN, and LIN in finding semantic relationships among tags in a folksonomy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {Social networks have become the main media for information dissemination in the so-called Web 2.0. The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Körner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times. Our results show that social tagging is a promising practice for e-learning; however some issues must be addressed to prevent an excessive number of categorizer students and, also, a premature convergence of the vocabulary of tags. Our conclusions are specific for the setting of our experiment, but we generalize them as much as possible suggesting guidelines of how to use social tagging in e-learning.},

  abstract  = {Social media systems are becoming more and more popular nowadays. In order to face the overload in the amount of users and content available in these systems, social recommender systems have been developed and are largely studied in the literature. A form of social media, known as social bookmarking system, allows to share bookmarks in a social network. A user adds as a friend or follows another user and receives updates on the bookmarks added by that user. However, no approach in the literature proposes friend recommender systems in the social bookmarking domain. In this paper, we present an analysis of the state-of-the-art on user recommendation in social environments and of the structure of a social bookmarking system, in order to derive a design and an architecture of a friend recommender system in the social bookmarking domain. This study can be useful for any future research in this area, by highlighting the aspects that characterize this domain and the features that this type of recommender system has to offer.},

  abstract = {One potential disadvantage of social tagging systems is that due to the lack of a centralized vocabulary, a crowd of users may never manage to reach a consensus on the description of resources (e.g., books, images, users, or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of resources in social tagging systems may become semantically stable over time, as more and more users tag them and implicitly agree on the relative importance of tags for a resource. At the same time, previous work has raised an array of new questions such as: 1) how can we assess semantic stability in a robust and methodical way? 2) does the semantic stabilization varies across different social tagging systems and ultimately, and 3) what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in such systems? In this work, we tackle these questions by: 1) presenting a novel and robust method, which overcomes a number of limitations in existing methods; 2) empirically investigating semantic stabilization in different social tagging systems with distinct domains and properties; and 3) detecting potential causes of stabilization and implicit consensus, specifically imitation behavior, shared background knowledge and intrinsic properties of natural language. Our results show that tagging streams that are generated by a combination of imitation dynamics and shared background knowledge exhibit faster and higher semantic stability than tagging streams that are generated via imitation dynamics or natural language phenomena alone.},

  abstract  = {Many automated software engineering approaches, including code search, bug report categorization, and duplicate bug report detection, measure similarities between two documents by analyzing natural language contents. Often different words are used to express the same meaning and thus measuring similarities using exact matching of words is insufficient. To solve this problem, past studies have shown the need to measure the similarities between pairs of words. To meet this need, the natural language processing community has built WordNet which is a manually constructed lexical database that records semantic relations among words and can be used to measure how similar two words are. However, WordNet is a general purpose resource, and often does not contain software-specific words. Also, the meanings of words in WordNet are often different than when they are used in software engineering context. Thus, there is a need for a software-specific WordNet-like resource that can measure similarities of words. In this work, we propose an automated approach that builds a software-specific WordNet like resource, named WordSimSEDB, by leveraging the textual contents of posts in StackOverflow. Our approach measures the similarity of words by computing the similarities of the weighted co-occurrences of these words with three types of words in the textual corpus. We have evaluated our approach on a set of software-specific words and compared our approach with an existing WordNet-based technique (WordNetres) to return top-k most similar words. Human judges are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two techniques. We find that WordNetres returns no result for 55 % of the queries. For the remaining queries, WordNetres returns significantly poorer results.},

Tagging is in fact a sharply skewed process in which a small minority of users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations. Using data from the social music site Last.fm as a case study, this paper explores the implications of this tagging imbalance. Partitioning the folksonomy into two halves - one created by the prolific minority and the other by the non-prolific majority of taggers - we examine the large-scale differences in these two sub-folksonomies and the users generating them, and then explore several possible accounts of what might be driving these differences. We find that prolific taggers preferentially annotate content in the long-tail of less popular items, use tags with higher information content, and show greater tagging expertise. These results indicate that "supertaggers" not only tag more than their counterparts, but in quantifi- ably different ways. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

  abstract      = {User-generated content shapes the dynamics of the World Wide Web. In particular, collaborative tagging represents a simple, yet powerful, feature that enables users to share and collaboratively annotate content such as photos and URLs. This collaborative behavior and the pool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing systems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to first understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work addresses this issue by characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea and del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of information (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users' tag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems. The analysis of the patterns of information production shows that users publish new content more often than they annotate already existing content in the system. The opposite, however, occurs for tags; the level of tag reuse is much higher. The study of the temporal dynamics of user vocabularies shows that the growth rate of tag vocabularies across the user population over time decreases at early ages, stabilizes, and returns to increase for older users. Moreover, a closer look into the change of vocabulary contents over time shows that despite the fact that tag vocabularies are slowly growing in size with user age, the relative frequency in which each tag is used converges relatively quickly in a users lifetime. Finally, the characterization of social aspects of tagging unveils the relationship between the implicit user ties, as inferred from the similarity between users' activity, and their explicit social ties, as represented by co-membership in discussion groups or semantic similarity between tag vocabularies. © First Monday, 1995-2014.},

In line with distributed cognition theories, we look at both the tags students use and their strength of representation in memory. We hypothesize that categories get more differentiated over time as students learn, and that semantic stabilization on the group level (i.e. the convergence in the use of tags) mediates this relationship. Results of a field experiment that tested the impact of topic study duration on the specificity of tags confirms these hypotheses, although it was not study duration that produced this effect, but rather the effectiveness of the collaborative taxonomy the groups built. In the groups with higher levels of semantic stabilization, we found use of more specific tags and better representation in memory. We discuss these findings with regard to the important role of the information value of tags that would drive both the convergence on the group level as well as a shift to more specific levels of categorization. We also discuss the implication for cognitive science research by highlighting the importance of collaboratively built artefacts in the process of how knowledge is acquired, and implications for educational applications of collaborative tagging environments. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Existing methods focus on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on the final annotation performance.},

  abstract = {Users can enjoy personalized services provided by various context-aware applications that collect users' contexts through sensor-equipped smartphones. Meanwhile, serious privacy concerns arise due to the lack of privacy preservation mechanisms. Currently, most mechanisms apply passive defense policies in which the released contexts from a privacy preservation system are always real, leading to a great probability with which an adversary infers the hidden sensitive contexts about the users. In this paper, we apply a deception policy for privacy preservation and present a novel technique, FakeMask, in which fake contexts may be released to provably preserve users' privacy. The output sequence of contexts by FakeMask can be accessed by the untrusted context-aware applications or be used to answer queries from those applications. Since the output contexts may be different from the original contexts, an adversary has greater difficulty in inferring the real contexts. Therefore, FakeMask limits what adversaries can learn from the output sequence of contexts about the user being in sensitive contexts, even if the adversaries are powerful enough to have the knowledge about the system and the temporal correlations among the contexts. The essence of FakeMask is a privacy checking algorithm which decides whether to release a fake context for the current context of the user. We present a novel privacy checking algorithm and an efficient one to accelerate the privacy checking process. Extensive evaluation experiments on real smartphone context traces of users demonstrate the improved performance of FakeMask over other approaches.},

In collaborative tagging systems, which allow users to assign freeform textual labels to digital resources, it is generally assumed that tags function as memory cues that facilitate future retrieval of the resources to which they are assigned. There is, however, little empirical evidence demonstrating that this is in fact the case. Employing large-scale music listening and tagging data from the social music website Last.fm as a case study, we present a set of time series and information theoretic analytic methods we are using to explore how patterns of content tagging and interaction support or refute the hypothesis that tags function as retreival cues. Early results are, on average, consistent with the hypothesis. There is an immediate practical application of this work to those working with collaborative tagging systems (are user motivations what we think they are?), but our work also comprises contributions of interest to the cognitive science community: First, we are expanding our understanding of how people generate and use memory cues “in the wild.” Second, we are enriching the “toolbox” available to cognitive scientists for studying cognition using large-scale, ecologically valid data that is latent in the logged activity of web users. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract  = {An important challenge in Agile Global Software Development (AGSD) is architectural knowledge vaporization, i.e., the loss of technical knowledge due to a lack of documentation. In a previous work we identified that technical knowledge is usually available in unstructured textual electronic means (e.g. chat, mail, blogs, etc. - also known as UTEMs) used by AGSD workers during development, although not necessarily easily accessible. Also, we proposed the concept of Knowledge Condensation as a means to recover knowledge from UTEMs, by introducing a structure to their contents along with means to retrieve knowledge. In this work we present our first step towards a Knowledge Condensation tool, through a prototype tagging mechanism to structure architectural knowledge during UTEM interactions. We evaluated the prototype and obtained the following results: (1) a high perception of usefulness and a high projected intention of use, and (2) the identification of 6 tagging behavior profiles from participants. These tagging behaviors can be grouped as (i) participants who tag as expected, (ii) participants who tag more than expected, and (ii) participants who tag less than expected. These results suggest that it is important to cope with "little or no tagging" and "excessive tagging" behaviors to implement knowledge condensation based on UTEM tagging. Furthermore, we identified that tagging could be a good option to structure UTEM interactions, and to retrieve architectural knowledge from UTEM logs. Future work includes improving the tagging mechanism prototype based on the participants' suggestions and overall evaluation results, and implementing a searcher prototype to further evaluate the concept of knowledge condensation based on tagging of UTEM interactions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we first offer an overview of advances in the field of distance metric learning. Then, we empirically compare selected methods using a common experimental protocol. The number of distance metric learning algorithms proposed keeps growing due to their effectiveness and wide application. However, existing surveys are either outdated or they focus only on a few methods. As a result, there is an increasing need to summarize the obtained knowledge in a concise, yet informative manner. Moreover, existing surveys do not conduct comprehensive experimental comparisons. On the other hand, individual distance metric learning papers compare the performance of the proposed approach with only a few related methods and under different settings. This highlights the need for an experimental evaluation using a common and challenging protocol. To this end, we conduct face verification experiments, as this task poses significant challenges due to varying conditions during data acquisition. In addition, face verification is a natural application for distance metric learning because the encountered challenge is to define a distance function that: 1) accurately expresses the notion of similarity for verification; 2) is robust to noisy data; 3) generalizes well to unseen subjects; and 4) scales well with the dimensionality and number of training samples. In particular, we utilize well-tested features to assess the performance of selected methods following the experimental protocol of the state-of-the-art database labeled faces in the wild. A summary of the results is presented along with a discussion of the insights obtained and lessons learned by employing the corresponding algorithms.},

Existing methods to collaborative filtering (CF) emphasize to scale well up to large and sparse dataset, lacking of scalable approach to dealing with new data. In this paper, we consider a novel method for alleviating the problem by incorporating content-based information about users and items, i.e., tags and keywords. The user-item ratings imply the relevance of users’ tags to items’ keywords, so we convert the direct prediction on the user-item rating matrix into the indirect prediction on the tag-keyword relation matrix that adopts to the emergence of new data. We first propose a novel neighborhood approach for building the tag-keyword relation matrix based on the statistics of tag-keyword pairs in the ratings. Then, with the relation matrix, we propose a 3-factor matrix factorization model over the rating matrix, for learning every user’s interest vector for selected tags and every item’s correlation vector for extracted keywords. Finally, we integrate the relation matrix with the two kinds of vectors to make recommendations. Experiments on real dataset demonstrate that our method not only outperforms other state-of-the-art \{CF\} algorithms for historical data, but also has good scalability for new data. },

Most focus on popular subsets, e.g., images containing landmarks or associated to Wikipedia articles. In this work we are concerned with the problem of accurately finding the location where a photo is taken without needing any metadata, that is, solely by its visual content. We also recognize landmarks where applicable, automatically linking them to Wikipedia. We show that the time is right for automating the geo-tagging process, and we show how this can work at large scale. In doing so, we do exploit redundancy of content in popular locations---but unlike most existing solutions, we do not restrict to landmarks. In other words, we can compactly represent the visual content of all thousands of images depicting e.g., the Parthenon and still retrieve any single, isolated, non-landmark image like a house or a graffiti on a wall. Starting from an existing, geo-tagged dataset, we cluster images into sets of different views of the same scene. This is a very efficient, scalable, and fully automated mining process. We then align all views in a set to one reference image and construct a 2D scene map. Our indexing scheme operates directly on scene maps. We evaluate our solution on a challenging one million urban image dataset and provide public access to our service through our online application, VIRaL.},

  abstract  = {Informal discussions on social platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow) accumulates a large body of programming knowledge in natural language text. Natural language process (NLP) techniques can be exploited to harvest this knowledge base for software engineering tasks. To make an effective use of NLP techniques, consistent vocabulary is essential. Unfortunately, the same concepts are often intentionally or accidentally mentioned in many different morphological forms in informal discussions, such as abbreviations, synonyms and misspellings. Existing techniques to deal with such morphological forms are either designed for general English or predominantly rely on domain-specific lexical rules. A thesaurus of software-specific terms and commonly-used morphological forms is desirable for normalizing software engineering text, but very difficult to build manually. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to build such a thesaurus. Our approach identifies software-specific terms by contrasting software-specific and general corpuses, and infers morphological forms of software-specific terms by combining distributed word semantics, domain-specific lexical rules and transformations, and graph analysis of morphological relations. We evaluate the coverage and accuracy of the resulting thesaurus against community-curated lists of software-specific terms, abbreviations and synonyms. We also manually examine the correctness of the identified abbreviations and synonyms in our thesaurus. We demonstrate the usefulness of our thesaurus in a case study of normalizing questions from Stack Overflow and CodeProject.},

To provide personalized services, a user model is usually required. We address the setting adopted by the majority of previous work, where a user model consists solely of the user’s past information. We construct an augmented user model from a number of tags and documents. These resources are further processed according to the user’s past information by exploring external knowledge base. A novel generative model is proposed for user model generation. This model leverages recent advances in neural language models such as Word Embeddings with latent semantic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We further present a new query expansion method to facilitate the desired personalized retrieval. Experiments conducted by utilizing real-world collaborative tagging data show that the methods proposed in the current paper outperform several non-personalized methods as well as existing personalized search methods by utilizing user models solely constructed from usage histories. © 2017, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Tags can be helpful if used for the recommendation since they reflect characteristic content features of the resources. However, there are few researches which introduce tags into the recommendation. This paper proposes a tag-based recommendation framework for scientific literatures which models the user interests with tags and literature keywords. A hybrid recommendation algorithm is then applied which is similar to the user-user collaborative filtering algorithm except that the user similarity is measured based on the vector model of user keywords other than the rating matrix, and that the rating is not from the user but represented as user-item similarity computed with the dot-product-based similarity instead of the cosine-based similarity. Experiments show that our tag-based algorithm is better than the baseline algorithm and the extension of user model and dot-product-based similarity computation are also helpful. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  abstract  = {Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community Web sites.},

A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classification schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from "popular" tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

Consequently, effective searching for the most related neighbors is critical for the success of the recommendations. In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages. In this paper, we propose a new collaborative filtering approach TBCF (Tag-based Collaborative Filtering) based on the semantic distance among tags assigned by different users to improve the effectiveness of neighbor selection. That is, two users could be considered similar not only if they rated the items similarly, but also if they have similar cognitions over these items. We tested TBCF on real-life datasets, and the experimental results show that our approach has significant improvement against the traditional cosine-based recommendation method while leveraging user input not explicitly targeting the recommendation system.

In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of network-aware search. We investigate efficient top-k processing when the score of an answer is computed as its popularity among members of a seeker's network. We argue that obvious adaptations of top-k algorithms are too space-intensive, due to the dependence of scores on the seeker's network. We therefore develop algorithms based on maintaining score upper-bounds. The global upper-bound approach maintains a single score upper-bound for every pair of item and tag, over the entire collection of users. The resulting bounds are very coarse. We thus investigate clustering seekers based on similar behavior of their networks. We show that finding the optimal clustering of seekers is intractable, but we provide heuristic methods that give substantial time improvements. We then give an optimization that can benefit smaller populations of seekers based on clustering of taggers.

Tag information can be used for many purposes (e.g. user profiling, recommendations, clustering etc), though the benefit of tags for search is by far the most discussed usage. Tag types differ largely across systems and previous studies showed that, while some tag type categories might be useful for some particular users when searching, they may not bring any benefit to others. The present paper proposes an approach which utilizes rule-based as well as model-based methods, in order to automatically identify exactly these different types of tags. We compare the automatic tag classification produced by our algorithms against a ground truth data set, consisting of manual tag type assignments produced by human raters. Experimental results show that our methods can identify tag types with high accuracy, thus enabling further improvement of systems making use of social tags. © 2009 Springer.},

  abstract        = {What makes a song to a chart hit? Many people are trying to find the answer to this question. Previous attempts to identify hit songs have mostly focused on the intrinsic characteristics of the songs, such as lyrics and audio features. As social networks become more and more popular and some specialize on certain topics, information about users' music tastes becomes available and easy to exploit. In the present paper we introduce a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks for becoming hits, which instead of relying on intrinsic characteristics of the tracks directly uses data mined from a music social network and the relationships between tracks, artists and albums. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through a set of experiments and the results indicate good accuracy in correctly identifying music hits, as well as significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2009 Springer.},

In contrast to more elaborate ways of organizing resources, such as taxonomies or ontologies, tagging is very easy to use and understand. Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit, formalized, structures. By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles (a set of related tags) can automatically be derived from a bag of tags. Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling. For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency. We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way. We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance.},

Apart from tag similarity, an interesting parameter to be analyzed during the clustering/mining process in such data is the actual time that each tagging activity occurred. Indeed, holding a temporal dimension unfolds macroscopic and microscopic views of tagging, highlights links between objects for specific time periods and, in general, lets us observe how the users' tagging activity changes over time. In this article, we propose a time-aware user/tag clustering approach, which groups together similar users and tags that are very “active” during the same time periods. Emphasis is given on using varying time scales, so that we distinguish between clusters that are robust at many time scales and clusters that are somehow occasional, i.e. they emerge, only at a specific time period.},

The basic level advantage describes availability in memory of certain preferred levels of taxonomic abstraction when categorizing objects and has been shown to vary with level of expertise. In the study, groups of students tagged internet resources for a 10-week period. We measured the availability of tags in memory with an association test and a relevance rating and found a basic level advantage for tags from more general as opposed to specific levels of the taxonomy. An interaction with expertise also emerged. Contrary to our expectations, groups that spent less time to develop a shared understanding shifted to more specific levels as compared to groups that spent more time on a topic. We attribute this to impaired collaboration in the groups. We discuss implications for personalized tag and resource recommendations.},

Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts. Thus there seems to be considerable scope for the use of tag recommendation systems and other tools that can make the tagging process more consistent.},

The collective knowledge expressed though user-annotated data has a big potential, but needs to be filtered in a digest form so that the search result better reflects the users' preferences and actual aims. Starting from these considerations, our work presents an agent-based approach for a scalable semi-automatic generation of annotation tags, personalized on each user's preferences and tastes.

We propose a clustering method called “Tripartite Clustering” which clusters the three types of nodes (resources, users, and tags) simultaneously by only utilizing the links in the social tagging network. We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation-based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering. Compared to social-annotation-based K-means and Link K-means, Tripartite Clustering achieves equivalent or better performance and produces more useful information.},

This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomialtime approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

The 'Tagging' is a mean for users to express themselves freely through additions of label called 'Tags' to shared resources. One of the problems encountered in current tagging systems is to define the most appropriate tag for a resource. Tags are typically listed in order of popularity, as del-icio-us. But the popularity of the tag does not always reflect its importance and representativeness for the resource to which it is associated. Starting from the assumptions that the same tag for a resource can take different meanings for different users, and a tag from a knowledgeable user would be more important than a tag from a novice user, we propose an approach for weighting resource's tags based on user profile. For this we define a user model for his integration in the tag weight calculation and a formula for this calculation, based on three factors namely the user, the degree of approximation between his interest centers and the resource field, expertise and personal assessment for tags associated to the resource. A resource descriptor containing the best tags is created. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract  = {Social communication websites has been an emerging type of a Web service that helps users to share their resources. For providing efficient similarity search of tag set in a social tagging system, we propose a multi-level hierarchical index structure to group similar tag sets. Not only the algorithms of similarity searches of tag sets, but also the algorithms of deletion and updating of tag sets by using the constructed index structure are provided. Furthermore, we define a modified hamming distance function on tag sets, which consider the semantically relatedness when comparing the members for evaluating the similarity of two tag sets. This function is more applicable to evaluate the similarity search of two tag sets. A systematic performance study is performed to verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experiment results show that the proposed MHIB approach further improves the pruning effect of the previous work which constructs a two-level index structure. Especially, the MHIB approach is well scalable with respect to the three parameters when using either the hamming distance or the modified hamming distance for similarity measure. Although the insertion operation of the MHIB approach requires higher cost than the naïve method, with the assistant of the constructed inverted list of clusters, it performs faster than the previous work. Besides, the cost of performing deletion operation by using the MHIB approach is much less than the other two approaches and so is the update operation.},

  abstract  = {This study addresses the problem of inferring users' employment affiliation information from social activities. It is motivated by the applications which need to monitoring and analyzing the social activities of the employees from a given company, especially their social tracks related to the work and business. It definitely helps to better understand their needs and opinions towards certain business area, so that the account sales targeting these customers in the given company can adjust the sales strategies accordingly. Specifically, in this task we are given a snapshot of a social network and some labeled social users who are the employees of a given company. Our goal is to identify more users from the same company. We formulate this problem as a task of classifying nodes over a graph, and develop a Supervised Label Propagation model. It naturally incorporates the rich set of features for social activities, models the networking effect by label propagation, and learns the feature weights so that the labels are propagated to the right users. To validate its effectiveness, we show our case studies on identifying the employees of "China Telecom" and "China Unicom" from Sina Weibo. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the compared baseline ones.},

In contrast, editorial annotations from production music libraries are meant to be incisive in nature. We compare the efficiency of these two data sources in capturing semantic information on mood expressed by music. First, a semantic computing technique devised for mood-related tags in large datasets is applied to Last.fm and I Like Music (ILM) corpora separately (250,000 tracks each). The resulting semantic estimates are then correlated with listener ratings of arousal, valence and tension. High correlations (Spearman's rho) are found between the track positions in the dimensional mood spaces and listener ratings using both data sources (0.60 <; rs <; 0.70). In addition, the use of curated editorial data provides a statistically significant improvement compared to crowd-sourced data for predicting moods perceived in music.},

  abstract  = {With the permission of annotating blog posts with tags, tags has become one of the most important resources used to describe blogger features. However, due to the irregular quality of tags, not all tags are appropriate for representing blogger's preferences. Poor tags or spam tags confuse the actual user's preferences and spam terms, thus they should be detected before they are directly used to tag bloggers. A detailed quantitative analysis on the categories of tag spam in the blogosphere is presented in this paper. Taking advantage of abundant text contents in blog posts and the relatively stable semantic relationship between tags and their target posts, an unsupervised approach based on topic models is proposed to evaluate tag quality for blogger modelling in the blogosphere. The latent interest topics of a blogger are mined out through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The blog post of the blogger is represented as a distribution over latent topics and a latent topic is a distribution over words of the vocabulary. A tag is also expressed as a specific co-occurrence term vector. Ultimately, a scheme is devised to determine the similarity between each tag and its target blog post. Then the tags with less similarity value can be identified as poor tag. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves more promising performance than the baselines on datasets collected from Sina Blog, which is one of the biggest Chinese blogs.},

  abstract = {Recommendation systems play an important role in many practical applications that help users manage information and provide personalized recommendations. The context in which a choice is made is an important factor for recommendation systems. Recently, researchers extended the classical matrix factorization to enable generic integration of contextual information by modeling the relevant data as a tensor. However, current tensor factorization methods have two important limitations: (1) computing costs can be very high in practice and (2) they can only be applied to static conditions. In this paper, we propose the GPUTENSOR, a parallel tensor factorization algorithm, to accelerate the tensor factorization of large datasets to support efficient context-aware recommendations. The basic idea of this algorithm is to partition a tensor into smaller blocks and then exploit the inherent parallelism and high memory bandwidth of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to perform tensor related operations in parallel. Furthermore, based on the observation that contextual information changes dynamically and frequently, we present GPUTENSOR+, an effective incremental method that models the apparent changes of a tensor by adaptively updating its previously factorized components instead of recomputing them on the whole dataset every time data are changed. Experiments indicate that the proposed methods can achieve significant timesavings without a significant loss in accuracy. As an important data mining tool, these methods can be used a potential basis for many other interesting tensor applications, such as clustering, trend detection, social network analysis, and latent concept discovery.},

In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.},

The rapid adoption of these systems has led to an increasing amount of users providing information about themselves and, at the same time, a growing and rich corpus of social knowledge that can be exploited by recommendation technologies. In this context, tripartite relationships between users, resources, and tags contained in folksonomies set new challenges for knowledge discovery approaches to be applied for the purposes of assisting users through recommendation systems. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of folksonomy-based recommender systems.

The proposed methods are evaluated against real datasets and the results show that they are more efficient than previous methods, which are appropriate for a large number of web resources.

Because of the randomness and the personalization in users' tagging, tag research continues to encounter data space and semantics obstacles. With the min-max similarity (MMS) to establish the initial centroids, the traditional K-means clustering algorithm is firstly improved to the MMSK-means clustering algorithm, the superiority of which has been tested; based on MMSK-means and combined with latent semantic analysis (LSA), here secondly emerges a new tag clustering algorithm, LMMSK. Finally, three algorithms for tag clustering, MMSK-means, tag clustering based on LSA (LSA-based algorithm) and LMMSK, have been run on Matlab, using a real tag-resource dataset obtained from the Delicious Social Bookmarking System from 2004 to 2009. LMMSK's clustering result turns out to be the most effective and the most accurate. Thus, a better tag-clustering algorithm is found for greater application of social tags in personalized search, topic identification or knowledge community discovery. In addition, for a better comparison of the clustering results, the clustering corresponding results matrix (CCR matrix) is proposed, which is promisingly expected to be an effective tool to capture the evolutions of the social tagging system.},

Although it is true that the popularity of a song can be greatly affected by external factors such as social and commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques, we attempt to extend previous work on hit song prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural network model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio information in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.},

Besides helping user to organize his/her personal collections, a tag also can be regarded as a user's personal opinion expression, while tagging can be considered as implicit rating or voting on the tagged information resources or items. The overview, presented in this chapter includes descriptions of content-based recommender systems, collaborative filtering systems, hybrid approach, memory-based and model-based algorithms, features of collaborative tagging that are generally attributed to their success and popularity, as well as a model for tagging activities and tag-based recommender systems.},

Using frequency data and co-word analysis matrices analyzed by multi-dimensional scaling, the authors discovered that tagging practices to some extent work in ways that are continuous with conventional indexing. Small numbers of tags tend to emerge by unspoken consensus, and inconsistencies follow several predictable patterns that can easily be anticipated. However, the tags also indicated intriguing practices relating to time and task which suggest the presence of an extra dimension in classification and organization, a dimension which conventional systems are unable to facilitate.},

Automatically classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper, we propose to exploit the semantic information embedded in tags supplied by users of social networking websites. Particularly, we consider the tag information by creating a graph of tracks so that tracks are neighbors if they are similar in terms of their associated tags. Two classification methods based on the track graph are developed. The first one employs a classification scheme which simultaneously considers the audio content and neighborhood of tracks. In contrast, the second one is a two-level classifier which initializes genre label for unknown tracks using their audio content, and then iteratively updates the genres considering the influence from their neighbors. A set of optimizing strategies are designed for the purpose of further enhancing the quality of the two-level classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data collected from Last.fm. Promising experimental results demonstrate the benefit of using tags for accurate music genre classification.

We have evaluated this method on a large repository of governmental Web services. The evaluation shows that relatively simple techniques are surprisingly cost-effective, saving hundreds of man-hours of semantic annotation effort. Moreover, the proposed method does not assume the availability of a preexisting ontology or controlled vocabulary. Instead, the space of annotations is dynamically built during the annotation process.},

We then perform a set of experiments to study the information value of search engine queries when treated as "tags" or "labels" for the web pages that both appear as a result and the user actually clicks on. We ask how much extra information these query
tags provide for web pages by comparing them to tags from the del.icio.us bookmarking site and to the pagetext. We find that query tags can provide substantially many (on average 250 tags per URL), new tags (on average 125 tags per URL are not present in the pagetext) for a large fraction of the Web.},

  abstract  = {The problem of automatic music mood classification is addressed by resorting to low-rank representation of slow auditory spectro-temporal modulations. Recently, it has been shown that if each data class is linearly spanned by a subspace of unknown dimensions and the data are noiseless, the lowest-rank representation (LRR) of a set of test vector samples with respect to a set of training vector samples has the nature of being both dense for within-class affinities and almost zero for between-class affinities. Consequently, the LRR exactly reveals the classification of the data, resulting into the so-called Low-Rank Representation-based Classification (LRRC). The performance of the LRRC is compared against three well-known classifiers, namely the Sparse Representations-based Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Nearest Neighbor classifiers for music mood classification by conducting experiments on the MTV and the Soundtracks180 datasets. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the LRRC among the classifiers that is compared to.},

Here, the knowledge is extracted from unlabeled objects through unsupervised learning and applied to perform supervised classification tasks. To mine more meaningful correlation knowledge, instead of using commonly used visual words in the traditional bag-of-visual-words (BoW) model, we discover higher level visual components (words and phrases) to incorporate the spatial and semantic information into our image representation model, i.e., bag-of-visual-phrases (BoP). By combining the enriched visual components with the textual words, we calculate the frequently co-occurring pairs among them to construct a cross-domain correlated graph in which the correlation knowledge is mined. After that, we investigate two different strategies to apply such knowledge to enrich the feature space where the supervised classification is performed. By transferring such knowledge, our cross-domain transfer learning method can not only handle large scale web multimedia objects, but also deal with the situation that the textual descriptions of a small portion of web images are missing. Empirical experiments on two different datasets of web multimedia objects are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed cross-domain transfer learning method.},

  abstract  = {The large amounts of software repositories over the Internet are fundamentally changing the traditional paradigms of software maintenance. Efficient categorization of the massive projects for retrieving the relevant software in these repositories is of vital importance for Internet-based maintenance tasks such as solution searching, best practices learning and so on. Many previous works have been conducted on software categorization by mining source code or byte code, which are only verified on relatively small collections of projects with coarse-grained categories or clusters. However, Internet-based software maintenance requires finer-grained, more scalable and language-independent categorization approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchically categorize software projects based on their online profiles across multiple repositories. We design a SVM-based categorization framework to classify the massive number of software hierarchically. To improve the categorization performance, we aggregate different types of profile attributes from multiple repositories and design a weighted combination strategy which assigns greater weights to more important attributes. Extensive experiments are carried out on more than 18,000 projects across three repositories. The results show that our approach achieves significant improvements by using weighted combination, and the overall precision, recall and F-Measure can reach 71.41%, 65.60% and 68.38% in appropriate settings. Compared to the previous work, our approach presents competitive results with 123 finer-grained and multi-layered categories. In contrast to those using source code or byte code, our approach is more effective for large-scale and language-independent software categorization.},

However, the problem of semantic service discovery based on the identification of fine-grained goals of users and services is still challenging due to the lack of semantic information in Web services. To enable the goal-driven semantic service discovery, we propose an automatic functional-goals tagging approach which employs a set of natural language processing (NLP) procedures based on the descriptions of Web services. In addition, to check the effectiveness of the functional-goals tagged, we designed a goal-driven semantic service discovery algorithm and compared it with other approaches: keyword-based, ontology-based, and topic-based service discovery. As results, our proposed goal-driven semantic service discovery achieved 75.7% of precision and 59.6% of recall (finally, F1=62%) that outperform other discovery approaches.},

  abstract      = {Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 1. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders. Copyright © 2014 ACM.},

Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, bursts of popularity in bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given URL. We also present a dynamic model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge. © CILIP.},

The main idea behind tagging is to allow users to provide metadata to the web content from their perspective to facilitate categorization and retrieval. There are many factors that influence users' tag choice. Many studies have been conducted to reveal these factors by analysing tagging data. This paper uses two theories to identify these factors, namely the semiotics theory and activity theory. The former treats tags as signs and the latter treats tagging as an activity. The theoretical analysis produced a framework that was used to identify a number of factors. These factors can be considered as categories that can be consulted to influence user tagging choice in order to support particular tagging behaviour, such as cross-lingual tagging.},

In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced, which is also known as the 'rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results showing that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when tag suggestions are presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is 'compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a 'compressed' top of the power-law distribution. We show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

Metadata - data about data - allows systems to collocate related information, and helps users find relevant information. The creation of metadata has generally been approached in two ways: professional creation and author creation. In libraries and other organizations, creating metadata, primarily in the form of catalog records, has traditionally been the domain of dedicated professionals working with complex, detailed rule sets and vocabularies. The primary problem with this approach is scalability and its impracticality for the vast amounts of content being produced and used, especially on the World Wide Web. The apparatus and tools built around professional cataloging systems are generally too complicated for anyone without specialized training and knowledge. A second approach is for metadata to be created by authors. The movement towards creator described documents was heralded by SGML, the WWW, and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. There are problems with this approach as well - often due to inadequate or inaccurate description, or outright deception. This paper examines a third approach: user-‍created metadata, where users of the documents and media create metadata for their own individual use that is also shared throughout a community.},

Typically, we select such words manually from a thesaurus of terms, or they are created using automatic keyword extraction techniques. Folksonomies are an increasingly well-populated source of unstructured tags describing Web resources. This article explores the value of the folksonomy tags as a potential source of keyword metadata by examining the relationship between folksonomies, community produced annotations, and keywords extracted by machines. The experiment has been carried out in two ways: subjectively, by asking two human indexers to evaluate the quality of the generated keywords from both systems; and automatically, by measuring the percentage of overlap between the folksonomy set and machine generated keywords set. The results of this experiment show that the folksonomy tags agree more closely with the human generated keywords than those automatically generated. The results also showed that the trained indexers preferred the semantics of folksonomy tags compared to keywords extracted automatically. These results can be considered as evidence for the strong relationship of folksonomies to the human indexer's mindset, demonstrating that folksonomies used in the del.icio. us bookmarking service are a potential source for generating semantic metadata to annotate Web resources.

In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of the question labelling practices by contrasting the use of community generated tags in the Live QnA service with the use of topic categories from a fixed taxonomy in the Yahoo! Answers service. We found that community tagging is related to higher levels of social interactions amongst users. Analysis of the most frequently used community tags reveals that active users may establish strong social ties around specific tags. Furthermore, the discriminative value of individual community tags can be low since the corresponding questions may cover a variety of topics. Thus, appropriate care needs to be taken when designing search, browsing, and recommender features for question discovery.},

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

The success of now-prominent tagging systems makes tagging "the natural way for people to classify objects as well as an attractive way to discover new material". One of the most challenging problems is to harvest the semantics from these systems, which can support a number of applications, including tag clustering and tag recommendation. We conduct detailed studies on different types of tag relations and tag similarity measures, and propose a scalable measure that we name Reliability Factor Similarity Measure (RFSM). We compare it with two other measures having similar scalability by integrating them into hierarchical clustering methods and performing tag clustering on a subset of Flickr data. The results suggest that RFSM outperforms those two measures when it is applies for tag clustering purpose. We also present an alternative way of utilizing discovered tag relations to set up tag refining rules in order to deal with some noise in the initial tag sets, which can in turn improve the precision of tag relations.},

  abstract      = {Social tagging is an innovative and powerful mechanism introduced with Web 2.0: it shifts the task of classifying resources from a reduced set of knowledge engineers to the wide set of Web users. Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation.},

In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems are popular tools for organization, sharing and retrieval of web resources. Their success is due to their freedom and simplicity of use. To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to inuence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor - resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be inuenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.

However, each day, thousands of new users are added to the system and the decompositions must be updated daily in a online fashion. In this paper, we provide analysis of the new user problem, and present fold-in algorithms for Tucker, Para Fac, and Low-order tensor decompositions.

Stacking is a technique in which the outputs (binary or probabilistic) of a set of binary classifiers (one for each tag) are used as input to a second stage of classification that attempts to exploit latent relationships between tags. This technique (known under a variety of names) has been used in a variety of multimedia tag annotation systems.

A set of descriptive tags has to be manually entered by users whenever they post a resource. This process can be simplified by the use of tag recommendation systems. Their objective is to suggest potentially useful tags to the user. We present a hybrid tag recommendation system together with a scalable, highly efficient system architecture. The system is able to utilize user feedback to tune its parameters to specific characteristics of the underlying tagging system and adapt the recommendation models to newly added content. The evaluation of the system on six real-life datasets demonstrated the system's ability to combine tags from various sources (e.g., resource content or tags previously used by the user) to achieve the best quality of recommended tags. It also confirmed the importance of parameter tuning and content adaptation. A series of additional experiments allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the system and tagging datasets and to determine the potential areas for further system development. © 2011 ACM.},

Tags express user interests, preferences and needs, but also automatically generate folksonomies. They can be considered as gold mine, especially for e-commerce applications, in order to provide effective recommendations. Thus, several recommender systems exploit folksonomies in this context. Folksonomies have also been involved in many information retrieval approaches. In considering that information retrieval and recommender systems are siblings, we notice that few works deal with the integration of their approaches, concepts and techniques to improve recommendation. This paper is a first attempt in this direction.

When changes are carried out under tough deadlines, software developers often do not follow software engineering principles, which results in deteriorated structure of the software. A badly structured system is difficult to understand for further changes. To improve structure, re-modularisation may be carried out. Clustering techniques have been used to facilitate automatic re-modularisation. However, clusters produced by clustering algorithms are difficult to comprehend unless they are labelled appropriately. Manual assignment of labels is tiresome, thus efforts should be made towards automatic cluster label assignment. In this study, the authors focus on facilitating comprehension of software clustering results by automatically assigning meaningful labels to clusters. To assign labels, the authors use term weighting schemes borrowed from the domain of information retrieval and text categorisation. Although some term weighting schemes have been used by researchers for software cluster labelling, there is a need to analyse the term weighting schemes and related issues to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these schemes for software cluster labelling. In this context, the authors analyse the behaviour of seven well-known term weighting schemes. Also, they perform the experiments on five software systems to identify software characteristics which affect the labelling behaviour of the term weighting schemes.},

  abstract      = {Originally introduced by social bookmarking systems, collaborative tagging, or social tagging, has been widely adopted by many web-based systems like wikis, e-commerce platforms, or social networks. Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags. Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

We use this methodology for evaluating how tag recommendations coming from (1) the popular tags at a resource or from (2) the user's own vocabulary influence the indexing quality. We show that recommending popular tags decreases the indexing quality and that recommending the user's own vocabulary increases the indexing quality. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

However, the (offine) evaluation of tag recommendation algorithms usually suffers from dificulties like the sparseness of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users. Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments.

  abstract      = {Tag recommender schemes suggest related tags for an untagged resource and better tag suggestions to tagged resources. Tagging is very important if the user identifies the tag that is more precise to use in searching interesting blogs. There is no clear information regarding the meaning of each tag in a tagging process. An user can use various tags for the same content, and he can also use new tags for an item in a blog. When the user selects tags, the resultant metadata may comprise homonyms and synonyms. This may cause an improper relationship among items and ineffective searches for topic information. The collaborative tag recommendation allows a set of freely selected text keywords as tags assigned by users. These tags are imprecise, irrelevant, and misleading because there is no control over the tag assignment. It does not follow any formal guidelines to assist tag generation, and tags are assigned to resources based on the knowledge of the users. This causes misspelled tags, multiple tags with the same meaning, bad word encoding, and personalized words without common meaning. This problem leads to miscategorization of items, irrelevant search results, wrong prediction, and their recommendations. Tag relevancy can be judged only by a specific user. These aspects could provide new challenges and opportunities to its tag recommendation problem. This paper reviews the challenges to meet the tag recommendation problem. A brief comparison between existing works is presented, which we can identify and point out the novel research directions. The overall performance of our ontology-based recommender systems is favorably compared to other systems in the literature.},

  abstract      = {The amount of diverse tags used to classify posts on Stack Overflow increased in the last years to more than 38,000 tags. Many of these tags have the same or similar meaning. Stack Overflow provides an approach to reduce the amount of tags by allowing privileged users to manually create synonyms. However, currently exist only 2,765 synonym-pairs on Stack Overflow that is quite low compared to the total number of tags. To comprehend how synonym-pairs are built, we manually analyzed the tags and how the synonyms could be created automatically. Based on our findings, we then present TSST, a tag synonym suggestion tool, that outputs a ranked list of possible synonyms for each input tag. We first evaluated TSST with the 2,765 approved synonym-pairs of Stack Overflow. For 88.4% of the tags TSST finds the correct synonyms, for 72.2% the correct synonym is within the top 10 suggestions. In addition, we applied TSST to 10 randomly selected Android related tags and evaluated the suggested synonyms with 20 Android app developers in an online survey. Overall, in 80% of their ratings, developers found an adequate synonym suggested by TSST.},

  abstract        = {Collaborative tagging systems have emerged as a successful solution for annotating contributed resources to online sharing platforms, facilitating searching, browsing, and organizing their contents. To aid users in the annotation process, several tag recommendation methods have been proposed. It has been repeatedly hypothesized that these methods should contribute to improving annotation quality and reducing the cost of the annotation process. It has been also hypothesized that these methods should contribute to the consolidation of the vocabulary of collaborative tagging systems. However, to date, no empirical and quantitative result supports these hypotheses. In this work, we deeply analyze the impact of a tag recommendation system in the folksonomy of Freesound, a real-world and large-scale online sound sharing platform. Our results suggest that tag recommendation effectively increases vocabulary sharing among users of the platform. In addition, tag recommendation is shown to contribute to the convergence of the vocabulary as well as to a partial increase in the quality of annotations. However, according to our analysis, the cost of the annotation process does not seem to be effectively reduced. Our work is relevant to increase our understanding about the nature of tag recommendation systems and points to future directions for the further development of those systems and their analysis. © 2015 ACM.},

  abstract      = {Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, have grown in popularity over the Web on account of their simplicity to organize several types of content (e.g., Web pages, pictures, and video) using open-ended tags. The rapid adoption of these systems has led to an increasing amount of users providing information about themselves and, at the same time, a growing and rich corpus of social knowledge that can be exploited by recommendation technologies. In this context, tripartite relationships between users, resources, and tags contained in folksonomies set new challenges for knowledge discovery approaches to be applied for the purposes of assisting users through recommendation systems. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of folksonomy-based recommender systems. Current recommendation approaches stemming from fields such as user modeling, collaborative filtering, content, and link-analysis are reviewed and discussed to provide a starting point for researchers in the field as well as explore future research lines.},

  abstract      = {Tags (keywords freely assigned by users to describe web content) have become highly popular on Web 2.0 applications, because of the strong stimuli and easiness for users to create and describe their own content. This increase in tag popularity has led to a vast literature on tag recommendation methods. These methods aim at assisting users in the tagging process, possibly increasing the quality of the generated tags and, consequently, improving the quality of the information retrieval (IR) services that rely on tags as data sources. Regardless of the numerous and diversified previous studies on tag recommendation, to our knowledge, no previous work has summarized and organized them into a single survey article. In this article, we propose a taxonomy for tag recommendation methods, classifying them according to the target of the recommendations, their objectives, exploited data sources, and underlying techniques. Moreover, we provide a critical overview of these methods, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we describe the main open challenges related to the field, such as tag ambiguity, cold start, and evaluation issues.},

  abstract  = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- ||},

abstract="Nowadays social tagging has become a popular way to annotate, search, navigate and discover online resources, in turn leading to the sheer amount of user-generated metadata. This paper addresses the problem of recommending suitable tags during folksonomy development from a graph-based perspective. The proposed approach adapts the Katz measure, a path-ensemble based proximity measure, for the use in social tagging systems. We model a folksonomy as a weighted, undirected tripartite graph. We then apply the Katz measure to this graph, and exploit it to provide tag recommendations for individual users. We evaluate our method on two real-world folksonomies collected from CiteULike and Last.fm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the recommendation performance and is effective for both active taggers and cold-start taggers compared to existing algorithms.",

        abstract = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}
